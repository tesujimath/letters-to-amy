Dear Amy,

How can we receive it when God speaks the impossible?

We have many examples of God speaking something impossible. Why does he do that?

Joshua was told to march the Israelite army around the walls of Jericho for seven days, and the walls would collapse, but even before he was so instructed, we find this.

{{< quote source="Joshua 6:2" >}}
The LORD said to Joshua, ‚ÄúSee, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

As if it had already happened! Joshua had to act on the basis that something impossible would happen. (And it did.)

Arguably Abraham had it even harder. He had to wait on an impossible promise, for twenty-five years! Waiting is perhaps harder than doing. And waiting for twenty-five years?!

There are other examples in the Bible of God speaking the impossible. But here's the thing: _he is still doing it today._

{{< quote source="Malachi 3:6a" >}}
‚ÄúI the LORD do not change.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Hebrews 13:8" >}}
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote author="Dallas Willard" source="Hearing God, Chapter 2" >}}
The Bible itself teaches that we are to understand it in terms of our own experience when it says that Paul, Barnabas and Elijah were human beings like us and that Jesus knows how we feel in our weaknesses because he himself ‚Äúin every respect has been tested as we are‚Äù (Heb 4:15). It means that _their experience was substantially like our own_.

We must pray for the faith and for the experiences that would enable us to believe that _such things could happen to us_. Only then will we be able to recognize, accept and dwell in them when they come.

How then can we receive it when God speaks the impossible? It is in fact a high honour, an invitation to demonstrate radical faith, and to grow in that faith. Perhaps God reserves such things for those for whom he has great plans, which will require great faith. (That's a little scary, isn't it?)

I hold on to this verse, which has kept me going for some years, and was itself given to me in a miraculous way.

{{< quote source="Numbers 23:19" >}}
God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?
{{< /quote >}}

This remains even if the promise is impossible.

{{< quote source="Jeremiah 32:26-27" >}}
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: ‚ÄúI am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

Wait on the Lord in faith, Amy, knowing that he who promised is faithful (Heb 10:23), even if it seems impossible!  üôè
