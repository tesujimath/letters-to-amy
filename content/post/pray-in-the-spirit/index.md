Dear Amy,

What is the last piece of the armour of God that is so often overlooked, indeed not even thought of as armour by many?

Understanding the Bible is about reading in paragraphs, which are the basic units of expression, things that belong together. Not every Bible translation has the same paragraph breaks, but in both of my preferred translations‚∏∫the NIV 1984 and the ESV‚∏∫the armour of God is described in just one paragraph, which in the NIV ends with this.

{{< quote source="Ephesians 6:18" >}}
And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.

How interesting that Paul would conclude his writing about the armour of God with this. Let's consider how praying in the Spirit could be considered a vital piece of the armour.

Firstly, what does ‚Äúin the Spirit‚Äù even mean? There seems to be much confusion today about what is the work of the Holy Spirit. Jim Packer wrote a whole book about it, _Keep in Step with the Spirit_, in which he outlines some of the secondary aspects that seem to occupy most people's attention, including power, revelation, and promptings, before arguing that _the primary work of the Holy Spirit is to mediate the presence of Jesus in our lives_. And indeed, this matches with what Jesus says of the Spirit in John 14.

What Paul writes in Romans is closely related.

{{< quote source="Romans 8:26" >}}
In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.
{{< /quote >}}

Let's not overthink this. Praying in the Spirit is simply praying in relationship with Jesus. There is no formula, just as there is no formula in human relationship. Mutual commitment and time spent together are required for the relationship to flourish. Jesus is committed! How he is that!! Are we?

We must do this on all occasions, and with all kinds of prayers and requests. Let's not get into a rut of formulaic praying. Let's sit with our wonderful Saviour and enjoy intimacy in relationship. In his presence we are protected in the spiritual battle.

Notice too that Paul's instruction is to pray for all the saints, that is, all Christians. In the spiritual battle we must avoid at all cost turning in on ourselves, as if we are the ones who matter most. By no means! Our brothers and sisters in Christ are the ones we must love, and continue to lift up before the Lord.

Pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests, Amy, for all the saints! üôè
