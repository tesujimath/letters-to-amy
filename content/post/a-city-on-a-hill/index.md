Dear Amy,

How can we shine for Jesus?

For Jesus‚∏∫that's the most important thing. Consider what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount.

{{< quote source="Matthew 5:14-16" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
‚ÄúYou are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. Let your light so shine before others that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
{{< /quote >}}

Which is the pivotal word here? The answer is _so_, but it is not all that clear. To be sure, this is the alternative translation given in the footnote in the ESV. The mainline translation is like the NIV rendering, neither of which are particularly helpful: _In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven._

Unfortunately this phrasing obscures what really matters. At times like this I turn to the NASB, the most literal translation of them all, the one that remains closest to the original language. Here's what we find there.

{{< quote source="Matthew 5:16 (NASB)" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
{{< /quote >}}

Do you see? _In such a way that they ... glorify your Father who is in heaven_.

In such a way. That is how we must shine, for there are two strikingly different ways shining ones could be received. ‚ÄúOh wow, Simon is amazing, isn't he?‚Äù Or, ‚Äúoh wow, have you noticed the transforming grace at work in Simon's life? The Lord is amazing, isn't he?‚Äù

My ego craves one of these but it is the other that glorifies the Lord. I must confess and repent and shine in such a way that they glorify my Heavenly Father. All the glory must go to him. That must be my heart's desire, and so I must die to self.

As usual, the Apostle Paul focuses on the main point with exceeding clarity.

{{< quote source="2 Corinthians 4:6-7" url="/ref/2-corinthians" >}}
For God, who said, ‚ÄúLet light shine out of darkness,‚Äù has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.

I am merely a clay jar, really nothing to behold at all, quite unimpressive and weak and somewhat vulnerable, but oh my, the treasure that I have within! The treasure that Jesus my Saviour has given me, that the Holy Spirit living in me is guarding and growing. The treasure that others must see as I live my life as a city on a hill. The treasure that will attract those outside the Kingdom to come in, and the treasure that will encourage my brothers and sisters in Christ to live lives that are ever more characterised by love and holiness. On dying to self, I find incredible joy in this city on a hill.

Let your light shine in such a way, Amy, that they glorify your Father who is in heaven! üôè
