Dear Amy,

If this wisdom in the secret heart is so precious in the sight of the Lord then surely it is worth pursuing with zeal and determination. How exactly can we do that?

{{< quote source="Psalm 119:9-16" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
How can a young man [or woman] keep his [or her] way pure? By guarding it according to your word.  
With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments!  
I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.  
Blessed are you, O LORD; teach me your statutes!  
With my lips I declare all the rules of your mouth.  
In the way of your testimonies I delight as much as in all riches.  
I will meditate on your precepts and fix my eyes on your ways.  
I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget your word.

Psalm 119 takes us into the depths, the depths of longing for the Lord, of desiring to be right with him, for an alignment of our secret heart with his will, and for his plans and purposes to be unfolded in our lives. Truly it challenges Ephesians Chapter One in my heart for which I would take to that desert island!

Here we see how to pursue wisdom in the secret heart. These are the headlines:

_With my whole heart_ ‚Äî no compromise! Ruthless consistency is required. Nothing can remain that is displeasing to the Lord, and in this we should expect to be tested. Will we take the Lord seriously or not? He is not deceived and nor should we be.

_I have stored up your word in my heart ..._ ‚Äî more than just knowing, this is loving‚∏∫loving to spend time with the Lord in his word. His word in our hearts must be that which fuels our very lives.

_... that I might not sin against you_ ‚Äî our ongoing sanctification, our growing in holiness, is foundational.

_Blessed are you, O Lord_ ‚Äî we must meditate on the goodness of God, over and over, dwelling in it, reminding ourselves of his mercy. All his ways are steadfast love and faithfulness! To displace those idols which compete for our affection we must grow such a love for our Lord.

_In the way of your testimonies I delight as much as in all riches_ ‚Äî our Heavenly Father reveals himself to us through his written word. May we delight to read it, and to read it more, and to surrender our will to it, joyfully, ever growing in relationship with the one who loves us beyond imagining.

_I will meditate on your precepts ..._ ‚Äî with a surrendered heart, taking all the time required for the Lord's holy word to permeate our hearts and lives.

_... and fix my eyes on your ways_ ‚Äî every cyclist knows that you end up in the place where you fix your eyes!

Ruthless consistency is required in pursuit of these things and we are not left alone in this. It is the heart-work of the Holy Spirit, his utmost desire for us, but we must not overlook how much discipline is required on our part, as Paul tells us.

{{< quote source="1 Corinthians 9:24-25" url="/ref/1-corinthians" >}}
Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.

And lest we forget what is at stake,

{{< quote source="Matthew 5:8" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
‚ÄúBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.‚Äù

With all vigilance, Amy, pursue wisdom in the secret heart, for from it flow the springs of life! üôè
