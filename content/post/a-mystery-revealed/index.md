Dear Amy,

How can we know a mystery?

> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God‚Äôs grace that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ (Ephesians 1:7-9).

In an alternate reality, the Lord could have dealt with our sin as he did, and simply told us, it's ok, we can be friends again, I've sorted it out. But in our reality, _with all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will_. He desires us to know just what our rescue cost him, and what it cost his only son, as he lavished his grace on us. As he continues to lavish it.

We have redemption _through his blood_. The cost was enormous. The love that paid this price, unfathomable. The forgiveness of sins and restoration of relationship with our heavenly father, beyond all worth. And the revelation of this mystery, according to his good pleasure.

Do we understand what has been done for us, and why? The Lord desires that we do.

(I notice there's still plenty of treasure from this chapter to be unearthed, so we're not about to escape from this desert island just yet!)

Know the mystery, Amy, and love the author of the mystery who has made it known! üôè
