Dear Amy,

What difference does it make that Jesus is alive?

Before we get into that, let's firstly celebrate the joyous truth of it: Jesus is alive! He is risen indeed! Hallelujah!

So, what difference does it make?

{{< quote source="Romans 5:8-9" url="/ref/romans" >}}
But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.
{{< /quote >}}

We are justified in the sight of God by Jesus' blood, accomplished by his death on the cross. This is amazing grace, freely given by the one who loves us beyond imagining. Praise him! By this our sins are counted against us no more. The slate is wiped clean. And wiped clean again. And again.

And yet, this is only half a gospel. Paul underlines it for us.

{{< quote source="1 Corinthians 15:17-19" url="/ref/1-corinthians" >}}
And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.
{{< /quote >}}

Even so, it's not hard to notice some who live by justification alone‚∏∫grateful for forgiveness of sins, muddling along in life, asking for forgiveness over and over for those same besetting sins‚∏∫poor beggars.

Without the power of the resurrection there would be no victory. We would still be in our sins, all of us, over and over. And after that, only death‚∏∫a people most to be pitied. Poor beggars.

But it is not so!

{{< quote source="Romans 6:4-6" url="/ref/romans" >}}
We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.

For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
{{< /quote >}}

Because Jesus is alive, we walk in newness of life right now, by his resurrection power, no longer slaves to sin but rejoicing as slaves to righteousness, rejoicing in victory over sin. Hallelujah!

And also at the end of our earthly lives, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. Praise the Lord!

Jesus is alive, Amy!! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
