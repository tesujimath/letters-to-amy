Dear Amy,

How can we live confidently in the Lord's love?

Psalm 27 pretty much has it all. Here are the highlights.  “The LORD is my light and my salvation ... the stronghold of my life (v1). One thing I ask from the LORD ... that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life (v4). He will keep me safe in his dwelling ... and set me high upon a rock (v5). Your face, LORD, I will seek (v8).”

Constantly reminding ourselves of these things, and living them every day, every moment, is part of it. But then out of the blue comes v9, which suddenly expresses doubt and fear of rejection.  “Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, God my Saviour.”

Such sentiments occur throughout the Psalms, and this by the grace of God. Let's try to understand why.

The Lord's wisdom is beyond understanding, let's first acknowledge that. He has plans and purposes, and they are good. He desires us to walk by faith, to trust him absolutely, and he loves us, ruthlessly. That's an uncomfortable word! The walk of faith is not comfortable, nor should we expect it.

So while it can feel, at times overwhelmingly, like he has turned his face away and rejected us, he has not. He alone knows what he is doing, and he is deeply invested in us. That rejection is what Jesus received on the cross, so we never have to. And that is why we can assert with the Psalmist, “I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.” (v13)

How then can we live confidently? “Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.” (v14)

Be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord, Amy! 🙏
