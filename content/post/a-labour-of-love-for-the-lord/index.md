Dear Amy,

As you return to the village for another year of serving the Lord, know that he sees all that you do and all that you are with such approval, smiling down on you like the proud father that he is.

How can I know that?

Paul evidently had a particular fondness for and bond with the Thessalonians. You can see it in his writing, in the phrases he uses.

{{< quote source="1 Thessalonians 4:1" >}}
Finally, then, brothers and sisters, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more.
{{< /quote >}}

He urges them to continue to live their lives in a way which pleases God, _just as they were doing_. Just as _you_ are doing, Amy, and to do this more and more. And what do we know of that?

{{< quote source="1 Thessalonians 1:2-3, 6b-7" >}}
We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labour of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.

... for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
{{< /quote >}}

Paul had noticed their work of faith and labour of love and steadfastness of hope in Jesus, and so had the Lord, and it pleased him. And neither of them had failed to notice the affliction they endured, quite how hard it was for them to live like this, and that they did it with the joy of the Holy Spirit.

The Lord has surely not failed to notice how hard it has been for you, Amy, and how you have lived with the joy of the Holy Spirit, honouring him, an example to all the believers in Dunedin City Baptist Church and beyond. Well done indeed! We give thanks to God for you, constantly remembering you in _our_ prayers.

Look up and see with the eyes of your heart our loving Heavenly Father taking so much joy and delight in you, Amy, gently nudging Jesus in the ribs and saying, ‚ÄúLook at our daughter, how she lives!‚Äù üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
