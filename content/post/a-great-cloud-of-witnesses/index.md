Dear Amy,

Apparently we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, and this is a reason to run the race with perseverance. What's all that about?!

{{< quote source="Hebrews 12:1" >}}
Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
{{< /quote >}}

It's important that we understand this, because doesn't it sound just a little bit creepy? Are all these witnesses sitting in heaven watching us, and so had we better not embarrass ourselves for that reason? By no means! (as Paul would say). That's exactly what this is not saying.

Some of these witnesses are listed in Chapter 11, with this introduction.

{{< quote source="Hebrews 11:1-2" >}}
Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for.
{{< /quote >}}

The writer then goes on to list the incredible demonstrations of faith by these witnesses, and they are incredible. But what is it that they are witnessing? Is it us? No, it's not us. Here's what.

By their faith they are _witnesses to the Lord_, to his goodness and kindness and faithfulness. When we live lives of radical faith it points to the one who enables us to do that, to the one for whom we live. And they were commended for it and highly honoured because this is glorious, to live in such a way that our very lives bear testimony to the Lord. This is a powerful witness.

And this is why _we_ run the race with perseverance. It is a powerful witness. The only ones watching are our contemporaries (oh, and the Lord, obviously ‚Äî Ps 139, Rev 20:12). But if we run this race well, the Lord may choose to use _our_ witness to save some of _them_.

Run with perseverance, Amy, and join the great cloud of witnesses in testifying to the goodness, kindness and faithfulness of the Lord! üôè
