Dear Amy,

What is the turning point in the Easter story?

In fact there are two. We'll come to the joyous second, but let's not rush that. Now is the time to contemplate the mournful first.

I have been reading Mark's account of the last days of Jesus' life, from the triumphal entry into Jerusalem up until his death on the cross (Mark 11-15). There's much that happens, starting with Jesus clearing the temple, which had become a den of robbers. We see Jesus speaking and acting with power and authority. Until we don't.

The turning point is signalled when Jesus is before the high priest, being interrogated. Being accused.

But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.

Haven't you wondered about that? In fact Mark records here only one statement from Jesus.

{{< quote source="Mark 14:61-62" >}}
Again the high priest asked him, ‚ÄúAre you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am,‚Äù said Jesus. ‚ÄúAnd you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.‚Äù

Mark records Jesus speaking only once more, confirming Pilate's description of him, in his words as the king of the Jews. And after this, nothing.

And this is the turning point, over which I have been weeping. After confirming that he is indeed the Lord of all creation, from here on Jesus is no longer the one who does anything at all. Having given up all the power and authority which are his by right, he is now simply one who is done to. He makes himself nothing but the object of others' actions, completely and absolutely surrendered to their will, to the Father's will, like a lamb to the slaughter. And we read a factual, brutal account of what was done to him, culminating in this.

{{< quote source="Mark 15:22, 24" >}}
They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means ‚Äúthe place of the skull‚Äù).

And they crucified him.

The Lord of all creation, humiliated. Pierced. Crushed. Extinguished. The object of God's wrath. But let us be clear about what was happening. Just before he died, Jesus cried out in anguish:

{{< quote source="Mark 15:34" >}}
‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

I know the answer to this. You know the answer.

Marvel, Amy, even in the weeping, at that answer which is the Father's great love for you! üôè
