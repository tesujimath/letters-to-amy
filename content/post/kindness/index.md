Dear Amy,

What is one of the most important considerations when engaging with someone in a difficult conversation? When everything within you wants to make your point, to justify yourself with great vigour? When you have waited for so long and the time is now?

{{< quote source="Galatians 5:22" >}}
The fruit of the Spirit is ... kindness
{{< /quote >}}

How easy this is to overlook. Could I be overstating its importance though? I think not. Consider this.

{{< quote source="Jeremiah 9:24" >}}
‚ÄúI am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,‚Äù declares the LORD.
{{< /quote >}}

Kindness is remarkably prominent don't you think? And the Lord delights in it! And what of this, which characterizes Jesus as the embodiment of kindness and love?

{{< quote source="Titus 3:4-5" >}}
When the kindness and love of God our Saviour appeared, he saved us
{{< /quote >}}

Consider those who hurt us, and don't even know they have.  What better way is there to bless than with kindness? There's real power in this, power to heal, and power to save. It is a work of the Holy Spirit that we can live like this, in giving rather than receiving.

{{< quote source="Colossians 3:12" >}}
As God‚Äôs chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with ... kindness
{{< /quote >}}

Be filled with kindness, Amy, breathing it out as a blessing from the Holy Spirit! üôè
