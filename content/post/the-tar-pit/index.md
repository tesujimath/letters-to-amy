Dear Amy,

Have you ever chosen to take the opposite view than the one you would naturally hold, and found insight? Let's do that now. Let me commend to you the Pharisee, and let us find much to admire.

Why is this so hard? We have learned for the longest time to despise the Pharisees. I mean, they're the baddies, right? Well let's put that to one side for now. Jesus said of them:

{{< quote source="Matthew 5:20" >}}
‚ÄúI tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

Similarly Paul appealed to the Philippians about his own impeccable standards as a Pharisee (Philippians 3:4-6).

The Pharisees were nothing if not serious about honouring the Lord, putting many of us to shame with the level of discipline with which they lived their lives.

Now, as I strive to live a right life, exercising all of my discipline to honour the Lord, how do I see myself?

We would do well to consider this parable of Jesus.

{{< quote source="Luke 18:10-14" >}}
‚ÄúTwo men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed about himself: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men‚Äîrobbers, evildoers, adulterers‚Äîor even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'

‚ÄúBut the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'

‚ÄúI tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.‚Äù

As I observe someone struggling in life, am I tempted to think, I'm not like them?  And am I pleased not to be so?  Are you tempted to think likewise?

Despising the Pharisee prevents me from seeing the truth, which is in fact, such am I. No different from the one I disdain. No better.

{{< quote source="Romans 3:22-24" >}}
There is no difference ... for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
{{< /quote >}}

I find I am in truth stuck in the tar pit of self-righteousness with my Pharisaical heart.

{{< quote source="Romans 7:24-25a" >}}
What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God‚Äîthrough Jesus Christ our Lord!
{{< /quote >}}

Fixing my eyes on Jesus I cry out, Lord, I repent of my Pharisaical heart. Have mercy on me, a sinner. Rescue me!

Honour the Lord with your whole heart, with your whole life, Amy, and cry out to him, Lord, have mercy on me! üôè
