Dear Amy,

What is the next level of kindness which is seen in the story of Ruth?

{{< quote source="Ruth 2:1-2" url="/ref/ruth" >}}
Now Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, ‚ÄúLet me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favour.‚Äù And she said to her, ‚ÄúGo, my daughter.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

Here's where we start to see the next level of kindness, and it is the kindness of the Lord.

We must take care to notice what is going on here and what is not. The narrator has introduced Boaz to us but Ruth doesn't know anything about him and neither is Naomi thinking of him at this time. The plan for Ruth and Boaz to meet is entirely of the Lord, and it is his own kindness. Let's watch it unfold.

{{< quote source="Ruth 2:3" url="/ref/ruth" >}}
So she set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers, and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelech.
{{< /quote >}}

Notice that she just happened to come to that part of the field. It's not that she went there specifically. She really didn't know what she was doing!

{{< quote source="Ruth 2:4a" url="/ref/ruth" >}}
And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem.
{{< /quote >}}

Well I never! How interesting! Let's marvel at the grace and kindness and sovereignty of the Lord.

And just in case you're thinking that Naomi somehow set this up ...

{{< quote source="Ruth 2:19" url="/ref/ruth" >}}
And her mother-in-law said to her, ‚ÄúWhere did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

She too had no idea. But all that is only half of it.

Let's consider Boaz. He was clearly a wealthy and powerful man, a man of means. He had both young men to work in his fields and young women under his protection. He was also a man with a noble and kind heart. But he was both single and as far as I can see childless, and quite a bit older. He had probably had to come to terms with the fact that the opportunity to have his own family had passed him by, and perhaps there was in that a sadness that he had had to learn to live with.

Notice that his intentions towards Ruth were entirely honourable. He had power and influence but he was not about to wield them over this vulnerable young woman, no matter how attractive he found her.

{{< quote source="Ruth 2:8" url="/ref/ruth" >}}
Then Boaz said to Ruth, ‚ÄúNow, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women.
{{< /quote >}}

He saw himself solely as her protector. What an honourable man!

And when Ruth made her move, the move planned all along by the Lord, the move anticipated by and prepared for by the Lord's own kindness, what was his response?

{{< quote source="Ruth 3:10" url="/ref/ruth" >}}
And he said, ‚ÄúMay you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

Boaz saw this as Ruth's kindness to him, an older man, a kindness greater even than her kindness in caring for Naomi, that formerly bitter old woman. I wonder if he ever came to understand that it was first and foremost the kindness of the Lord.

And what was the result?

{{< quote source="Ruth 4:13, 17b" url="/ref/ruth" >}}
So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.

They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
{{< /quote >}}

Family values are passed down through the generations. How strong must have been the kindness passed on here‚∏∫not only that of Boaz and Ruth, but that of the Lord himself. Praise his holy name!

There's one final thing to notice.

{{< quote source="Matthew 1:1-2a, 5b-6" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

Abraham was the father of Isaac, and ...

... and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David the king.
{{< /quote >}}

Highly unusually in this genealogy and with great honour Ruth is mentioned as the mother. What an outcome for the kindness of a Moabite nobody, interwoven with the kindness of the Lord! Praise him!

Rest in the sovereignty and kindness of the Lord, Amy, for they are strong and sure! üôè
