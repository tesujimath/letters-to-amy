Dear Amy,

How is it that the living God, sovereign creator of the universe and Lord of all creation, terrifying in purity and holiness, a consuming fire, should be quite so very good and kind?

We had no right to expect that, did we? And yet that's how it is. Hallelujah!

Let's just see if we can gain some insight into the astonishing goodness of God. For there is something here which may not be well understood and may in fact be slightly uncomfortable. Let the psalmist explain, as we listen in on him speaking with the Lord.

{{< quote source="Psalm 119:68a" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
You are good and do good.
{{< /quote >}}

This is the heart of it, acknowledging the unconditional goodness of God. It is his very nature. Now let's consider that in the context of the rest of what the psalmist is saying. Here's the whole stanza.

{{< quote source="Psalm 119:65-72" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
You have dealt well with your servant, O LORD, according to your word. Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in your commandments. Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep your word. You are good and do good; teach me your statutes. The insolent smear me with lies, but with my whole heart I keep your precepts; their heart is unfeeling like fat, but I delight in your law. It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes. The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
{{< /quote >}}

The psalmist declares that the Lord has dealt well with him. And then we see his heartfelt cry to the Lord to teach him good judgment and knowledge. Why is this so necessary? Because as he continues we see something surprising and really quite uncomfortable. The Lord's goodness is being outworked here through affliction. We must not fail to notice this.

{{< quote source="Psalm 119:67, 71" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep your word.

It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes.
{{< /quote >}}

And somehow this is good. How can it be good for him to be afflicted? Notice that his acknowledgement of this is in immediate juxtaposition to his assertion of the goodness of God.

It is worth asking what is the nature of this affliction? We do not know what it comprises but if we look ahead we can determine its source and it is not what we might expect.

{{< quote source="Psalm 119:75" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
I know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
{{< /quote >}}

The psalmist is asserting with great determination the goodness of God and his righteousness. And that it is the Lord himself who is the source of his affliction. How are we to understand this?

We need to remind ourselves of the Lord's big picture plan for our lives, both now and especially in that time of affliction which may come, unsolicited and frankly unwelcome. But we can learn from the psalmist how we must respond to such. The psalmist's reward is increased love for the Lord and greater understanding of his goodness and somehow an ability to keep his precepts with his whole heart. What a reward! What a gift! The gift is received through affliction and yet it is such a gift of love.

{{< quote source="Jude 24-25" url="/ref/jude" >}}
Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.
{{< /quote >}}

The Lord's plans and purposes are not for our comfort and ease. Not remotely so! He has a much higher purpose, and it is for our ultimate good. If we are able to grasp this it is ultimately joyous.

What are we to do in response to this understanding? Simply trust and obey and surrender our will and all of our hopes and dreams to the one who is unfathomably good and kind‚∏∫Jesus, the lover of our souls.

Know that the Lord is so very good and kind, Amy, in whatever you may be experiencing! üôè
