Dear Amy,

What else can we learn from Elijah's faith-wobble?

He was running for his life, and after 120 miles or so he left his servant and continued alone.

{{< quote source="1 Kings 19:4" url="/ref/1-kings" >}}
But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, ‚ÄúIt is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.‚Äù

Here was a man empty and exhausted, utterly cast down, apparently at his end.

{{< quote source="1 Kings 19:5-8" url="/ref/1-kings" >}}
And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, ‚ÄúArise and eat.‚Äù And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, ‚ÄúArise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.‚Äù And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.

The journey to Horeb was at least another 250 miles. What a cake that must have been!

Notice what was the Lord's first response‚∏∫not that gentle rebuke which was to follow. The first response was practical and compassionate care and provision for his servant who was empty and utterly exhausted.

And then what? Elijah poured out his heart to the Lord, and you can be sure the tears were streaming down his face. Read for yourself the words of a broken man with nothing left to give, without hope and apparently all alone (1 Kings 19:10, 14).

And what was the Lord's response to that? He rescued him and restored him and gave him something to do (1 Kings 19:15-18). Let me paraphrase it like this.

‚ÄúIt's ok, Elijah, I've got this. And by the way, you're not alone. I have seven thousand others. And you are still useful to me. Come on, let's go again.‚Äù

And thus the Lord restored Elijah, gave him hope, and continued to work out his plans and purposes through him and through Elisha.

{{< quote source="1 Kings 19:19, 21" url="/ref/1-kings" >}}
So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat.

Then [Elisha] arose and went after Elijah and assisted him.

This is the same God who looks with such love on each one of us in our own brokenness and emptiness and exhaustion, and rescues and restores, and continues to use us for his Kingdom plans and purposes. Praise him!

His grace is sufficient for you, Amy, for his power is made perfect in your weakness! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
