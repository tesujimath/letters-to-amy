Dear Amy,

As we come to what Paul says about feet, I have been contemplating, what is it that feet do? Well clearly they go, and they dance. Since you're already acing both of these, I had to wonder whether I had anything at all for you this week!

{{< quote source="Ephesians 6:13, 15" >}}
Put on the full armour of God ... with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
{{< /quote >}}

Here are two thoughts, however, that I have had. May they encourage your heart.

Firstly, the armour of God is all about being prepared for battle. Doesn't the gospel of peace seem to be somewhat at odds with that? I was prompted to reread Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins' rousing eve-of-battle speech in the Iraq War. It is not long, but too much to include here in its entirety‚∏∫I encourage you to look it up. I was struck by the juxtaposition of ferocity and compassion, of the warrior on a mission of mercy.

{{< quote author="Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins" source="Fort¬†Blair¬†Mayne, Kuwait, 19¬†March¬†2003" url="https://www.royal-irish.com/stories/lieutenant-colonel-tim-collins-eve-of-battle-speech" >}}
‚ÄúWe go to liberate, not to conquer. We will not fly our flags in their country. We are entering Iraq to free a people and the only flag which will be flown in that ancient land is their own.

‚ÄúShow respect for them.

‚ÄúIf you are ferocious in battle remember to be magnanimous in victory.‚Äù

And so it is with the spiritual battle.

{{< quote source="Ephesians 6:12" >}}
Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
{{< /quote >}}

Those who seem to be our adversaries in this world are really not. We are bringers of the gospel of peace, and we go to liberate. May compassion define us in the battle.

Secondly, our feet must be fitted with _readiness_. Who can say when the Lord will choose to act with power and mercy by his Spirit in the lives of those around us? Let us anticipate that he will, and be ready.

Put on the full armour of God, Amy, and fit your dancing, going feet with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace! üôè
