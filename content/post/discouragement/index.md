Dear Amy,

Where does discouragement come from and what can we do about it?

The truth is, discouragement can sneak in at any time and begin its insidious work of erosion of faith and joy. Perhaps all we notice is being a little flat, a little down. Why does this happen, and why does it sometimes happen so suddenly?

There are many and varied reasons.

Sometimes the reasons are obvious: prolonged waiting, for healing, for deliverance, for the fulfillment of a promise; or fatigue, especially post-mission fatigue, when a work has been completed‚∏∫perhaps when a young and enthusiastic team leaves after a significant and high energy visit and all the energy seems to leave with them. And sometimes the reasons are less obvious and there is simply an absence of waypoints upon which to pin hope, or merely a nagging sense that we have dropped off other people's radar and there is no-one to notice whether we are flourishing or fading.

The question is, what to do? Paul knew.

{{< quote source="Colossians 2:1-3" url="/ref/colossians" >}}
For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

The truth is, we all need encouragement from our brothers and sisters in Christ. The journey of faith is not a solitary one. Our hearts are encouraged as we are knit together in love, one with another, but more than this. What could be more encouraging than to be reminded of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge which are in Jesus and which are Jesus? To hear ‚Äúcheer up‚Äù is of such limited comfort. But to hear ‚ÄúJesus is interceding for you at the right hand of the Father, even now‚Äù lifts me.

As you look ahead to your last few months in the village, Amy, know that the work you have been doing and the work that you will complete before you leave is of eternal significance. Not only is Jesus himself interceding for you, but together with the Father he is so pleased to see you completing your faithful service, persevering even when it is hard and there is no-one to say well done. So pleased with you. And so I say it now: well done, Amy!

I have one last insight for you, for sometimes when we need to hear such words of encouragement there is no-one speaking them to us. What then?

Consider how Paul regarded the Thessalonians, who were so dear to him.

{{< quote source="1 Thessalonians 2:19-20" url="/ref/1-thessalonians" >}}
For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? For you are our glory and joy.
{{< /quote >}}

Sometimes we long for a word of encouragement, and it does not come. So then we must speak it to another, affirm and encourage them in the Lord, and find in that, as Paul did, glory and joy.

With much love and encouragement to you, Amy, as you continue on in your faithful work for the Lord! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
