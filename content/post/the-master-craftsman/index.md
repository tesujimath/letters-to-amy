Dear Amy,

How can we be completely confident in surrendering to the Lord's will? Shouldn't we retain some level of control? What might he do in our lives, by the Holy Spirit unleashed with power and authority? Isn't it just all too scary?

Let me ask a different question which may provide some insight. If I invite the Spirit into my situation, into my life, how can I be sure he will do what I am hoping for? What I want?

Many leave this question unstated, and yet it remains in their subconscious, in the background, undermining confidence in the Lord and trust in him. But it must be articulated, because only then can we repudiate it. Of course he won't do what I want! The very idea is preposterous! He will do his own work, the work that he knows so well, at which he is the master. So the better question to ask is, what is that work?

We already considered this.

{{< quote source="Jude v24-25" url="/ref/jude" >}}
To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with exceeding joy‚∏∫to the only God our Saviour be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and for evermore! Amen.

His work is to keep us from falling and to present us before his glorious presence without fault and with exceeding joy.  It is a heart work, where he transforms us from wretches, having the smallest, meanest, most selfish lives and motives, into sons and daughters, having abundance of life and joy in the Lord, living as slaves to righteousness, with hearts bursting with love for our Saviour and for our brothers and sisters in Christ. And he will do whatever it takes to achieve this purpose, no matter the cost, to him or to us.

How can I know that?

{{< quote source="Romans 8:32" url="/ref/romans" >}}
He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all‚∏∫how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
{{< /quote >}}

Do not make the mistake as some have done, of thinking this means he will give us whatever we want. By no means! But he will give us whatever _he_ wants, in pursuit of his goal for us.

Surrender joyfully, Amy, and trust the master craftsman who knows his work, who along with his own Son, will graciously give you all things! üôè
