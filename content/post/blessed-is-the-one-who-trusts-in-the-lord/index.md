Just wondering how you are coping with the heat over there, Amy. And that made me think of this.

{{< quote source="Jeremiah 17:7-8" url="/ref/jeremiah" >}}
“But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.”

I think it's monsoon season there, so enjoy the irony. Praying for you 🙏
