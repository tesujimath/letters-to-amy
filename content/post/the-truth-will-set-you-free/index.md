Dear Amy,

Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching ... then you will know the truth ..." (John¬†8:31-32). Truth is more important now than ever, given the post-truth world in which we live, where people are inclined to define their own truth. Christians are not immune.

We are never more vulnerable than when we say, "the Lord told me ..."  What exactly do we mean by this? What interplay of conviction, imagination, emotion and coincidence are we leaning on? And what grounds do we have to trust any of that? We must take great care here.

Providentially, the Lord has told me a great deal, all of which is trustworthy and true. It was written down long ago, over 1200 pages. My best chance to grasp the truth is to read Scripture, diligently and comprehensively, with intellectual integrity and a surrendered heart, particularly when it becomes uncomfortable.

Notice that Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching ..."  It is not enough to read. We have to do it, to live and breathe his teaching, habitually and unceasingly. Only then can we really understand, and know the truth.

" ... and the truth will set you free." (John¬†8:32)

Be free, Amy üôè
