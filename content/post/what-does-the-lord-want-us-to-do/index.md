Dear Amy,

What does the Lord want us to do?

Surely there must be some special work that he's calling us to. Something that we have to carefully and prayerfully uncover, so we can live the life he has planned, and do the work he has for us. Surely?

Jesus was once asked exactly this. ‚ÄúWhat must we do to do the works God requires?‚Äù  Jesus answered, ‚ÄúThe work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.‚Äù (John 6:28-29)

That's a little enigmatic, don't you think? Or is it? Perhaps it's actually really straightforward! What would that look like? To believe in the one the Lord has sent?

Jesus, the very Son of God, came to rescue us. From sin, and shame, and failure, and all that drags us down. From the sin that separated us from the Father. He loves us so much, that he did this completely and comprehensively, and at what cost!

So, to really believe in him.  I am loved. I am rescued. I am free. No doubt. No fear. No shame. Only love. By our Father, and for our Father.  All that remains is to live in that love. In him, and through him, and for him, forever.

Live like you're loved, Amy! üôè
