Dear Amy,

Why have so many Christians thrown away the shield of faith?

{{< quote source="Ephesians 6:16" >}}
In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
{{< /quote >}}

Firstly, understand the nature of these flaming arrows. They are lies. Lies about us and lies about the Lord and what he has done. Jesus says of the devil,

{{< quote source="John 8:44b" >}}
‚ÄúWhen he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

But lies can be insidious. They must be stamped out before they take hold, like flames licking around. What do these lies do? They create doubt. And how do we combat doubt? By exercising and building faith! But how do we do this?

What is faith anyway? Those who think it is an intellectual acceptance of some revealed truth are so far away from real understanding. Faith is a _life lived_ upon the foundation of this truth from the Lord, upon Christ himself, fully committed, trusting and even depending on him to keep his promises. (And he will.) So, how to do this?

Ruthless consistency is again the key. I have to ask myself with brutal honesty, does my life reflect that I will one day stand before the Lord and give an account? Does my life reflect that I have understood Jesus teaching and am living by it in full obedience to him, joyously surrendered? Many seem not to understand this and then wonder why their faith is so small and why doubt is creeping in. Half-hearted belief is no belief at all.

Consider even this one thing that Jesus said.

{{< quote source="Matthew 19:30" >}}
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
{{< /quote >}}

The context of this is the rich young ruler, earnestly seeking but tragically unable to give up this life's riches and pleasures for the Kingdom, just like so many today. Why is it that even within the church so many are trying to be first? Do we really not believe Jesus?

{{< quote source="Matthew 6:33" >}}
But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
{{< /quote >}}

We may need some help with this. So let us ask our heavenly Father, who loves us beyond imagining.

{{< quote source="Psalm 119:18" >}}
Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.
{{< /quote >}}

May this be our most earnest prayer as we learn to wield the shield of faith and extinguish those flaming arrows. And let us observe the Lord's faithfulness in our lives as we live this life of faith, recognising that his faithfulness is in fact the ultimate faith builder.

Take up your shield of faith, Amy, and know that he who promised is faithful! üôè
