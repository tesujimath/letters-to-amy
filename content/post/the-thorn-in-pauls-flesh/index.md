Dear Amy,

What exactly was Paul's thorn anyway, and why does it matter?

There has been much speculation about the nature of Paul's thorn in the flesh (2 Cor 12:7-9), and of course we do not know.  Personally, I doubt it was any disability, of speech or of stature, nor any severe pain to endure. Rather I suspect it was something utterly shameful and humiliating, perhaps something in his own character. Something internal and deeply personal. Why do I think this?

In every other respect, Paul was the elite. Highly educated. Highly disciplined. Highly capable. Zealous. Purging every sin and making every effort to live a right life (Acts 22:3, Phil 3:4-6). These are not attributes that lead to humility! They are more likely to lead to arrogance, to smug self-satisfaction, to a sense of moral superiority. How can such a one be depending completely on the Lord, and be of any use in the Kingdom?

Paul rather was able to live with so much humility and dependence on the Lord _because of this_ (“in order to keep me from becoming conceited”, 2 Cor 12:7), being able to say, “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners⸺of whom I am the worst” (1 Tim 1:15). And to live with boldness. Such boldness!

When the shame of my past comes back to haunt me, to crush me, I do not deny it. I must not. The Lord lifts me, welcomes me, saves me, accepts me. Oh how I need him! I am not condemned. But in the rescue and the redemption, all pride is gone. My grateful heart loves the Lord, and seeks to honour him. And so I can live with levels of humility, gentleness and compassion which eluded me previously. The Lord is glorified, and I am diminished. I can die to self, and live for him, holding nothing back. Praise him!

Rejoice in the rescue, Amy, whatever form it takes! 🙏
