Dear Amy,

How can we be expectant and not disappointed?

Living with high expectations of oneself and others is surely right, but can lead to ongoing disappointment, as we and those around us fall short of what we aspired to do and to be. How can the same not be true of the Lord?

What should we expect of the Lord anyway?  “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (Jn 10:10).   “I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living” (Ps 27:13).  “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them” (Mk 11:23).  “Is anyone among you sick? ... the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up” (Jam 5:14-15).  “Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him” (Ps 91:14).  “You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the LORD your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed” (Josh 23:14).  “I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jer 32:27).  How are we not just setting ourselves up for disappointment?

However we deal with this, we must never lower our expectation of the Lord. He is the Creator, Almighty, Sovereign Lord, infinite in power and wisdom. He loves us his children absolutely, and he blesses us richly and without bounds. May we never doubt that!  And may we never limit our praying to what seems reasonable. If someone is sick, shame on me if I pray merely for their comfort rather than for miraculous healing.

To live with such expectation makes me so vulnerable, though. Vulnerable to disappointment. Vulnerable to the scorn of the sceptics. Vulnerable and defenceless. How can my faith survive this?

Recall that Abraham was strengthened in his faith (Rom 4:20). It is a work of the Lord. I commit completely, in faith, trusting. The Lord defends me.  It is miraculous grace.  The heartache may remain as I wait, in that amalgam of joy and pain which characterises the Christian life as we engage with the Lord's work in this broken world. But disappointment does not crush me, does not crush my faith. How does this work? It is a mystery, a wondrous gift of grace.

Oh my, I seem to have written another tome. Good job I do this only once a week, eh?

Lean on him, trust him for his impossible promises, and praise him for his miraculous grace, Amy! 🙏
