Dear Amy,

Why is it so important to be vulnerable?

Our every instinct is to protect and defend, to justify ourselves, and yet we must not do it!  Why is this?  Paul wrote to the Corinthians about his vision and the thorn in his flesh, concluding:

{{< quote source="2 Corinthians 12:9, 10" >}}
The Lord said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me ... I delight in weaknesses ... for when I am weak, then I am strong.
{{< /quote >}}

What does this look like?

When I am judged, even when the judgment is as ignorant as it is harsh, I choose not to defend myself. How easy is it to do this? It is the hardest thing! It is dying to self. (But, my integrity is not defined by what others think of me.)

Reputation is the idol of our age, both within and without the church, maybe the greatest barrier to the gospel, to the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, and to us honouring the Lord with our whole lives. Here are the four most oppressive words, that empty us of the Lord's power and make us utterly useless for him: _what will they think?_

What will they think of me? I choose not to care! And here is the reason to be vulnerable, to not care about this. Suddenly I can share the gospel with great power, and absolute confidence. I am invincible, because what defines me is unassailable! (2 Cor 5:17, Col 3:3)

“Let me reach down from my pedestal of perfection and set you on the right path, O hapless misguided sinner.” No! No! No! A hundred times no! That is the way of the Pharisee, and the Lord is not in it.

Rather, “Let me tell you of the one who rescued me”, risking the contemptuous, sneering reply, “What? Did you need to be rescued?” Yes, I did. I was rescued, am being rescued, will be rescued. It is ongoing, and I am unashamed. Praise the Lord!

Be vulnerable and unashamed, Amy! 🙏
