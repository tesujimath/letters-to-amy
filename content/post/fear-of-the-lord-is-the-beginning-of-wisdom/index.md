Dear Amy,

How can we know the will of the Lord? Let's look again into the treasure trove which is Psalm 25.

Who, then, are those who fear the LORD? He will instruct them in the ways he chooses (v12).  The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them (v14).

Tim Keller defines the fear of the Lord as this, in a sermon from Proverbs on the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom. "The fear of the Lord is a reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done."

My prayer for you is that you learn to live this more each day.
