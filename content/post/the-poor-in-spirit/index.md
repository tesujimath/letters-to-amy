Dear Amy,

What is it that is so remarkable about the blessing for the poor in spirit, the first thing Jesus said in The Sermon on the Mount, almost the very first thing he was recorded as saying publicly?

{{< quote source="Matthew 5:3" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
‚ÄúBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

Before we get to what is so remarkable here, let's first unpack what it means to be poor in spirit, because poor in spirit doesn't sound very blessed does it? Psalm 63 will help us.

{{< quote source="Psalm 63:1" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
{{< /quote >}}

The introduction to the psalm tells us that David wrote this when he was in the wilderness of Judah. The physical thirst experienced in that arid land parallelled the spiritual thirst of his being poor in spirit, being so aware of his need of God.

Don't think for a moment that there is any lack of desire for God among the poor in spirit, or any lack of understanding of his goodness and mercy. The truth is the complete opposite.

{{< quote source="Psalm 63:3" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you.
{{< /quote >}}

The Lord's steadfast love is better than life itself. There is full understanding here, along with the most desperate longing. 

And what then?

{{< quote source="Psalm 63:4-7" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
So I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands. My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips, when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night; for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.
{{< /quote >}}

There are two things we must notice.

Firstly, his life is hard‚∏∫so very hard. There is steadfast determination to praise, to trust, to honour the Lord, right alongside the sleeplessness. That's right. In the watches of the night, in the time for sleeping, sleep does not come. So the psalmist meditates on the Lord, on his goodness and kindness and faithfulness, and so must we.

And secondly, the blessing and satisfaction in the Lord which is so painfully longed for is in the future. It is not yet. My soul will be satisfied. I will sing for joy. There is both trust and determination here. But it is not yet. The joy is to come. And in the meantime?

{{< quote source="Psalm 63:8" url="/ref/psalms" >}}
My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.
{{< /quote >}}

These are both in the present tense, right here, right now. My Heavenly Father upholds me with his right hand in the longing and the sleeplessness, and my soul clings to him. I am poor in spirit, so very aware of my need for him, and he honours that.

And now we can understand what is so remarkable about the blessing for the poor in spirit.

{{< quote source="Matthew 5:3" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
‚ÄúBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

It is a present tense blessing, almost uniquely amidst the others (they shall be comforted; they shall inherit the earth; they shall be satisfied; they shall receive mercy; they shall see God; they shall be called sons and daughters of God ‚Äî Matthew 5:4-9).

Theirs is the kingdom of heaven, right now. There is nothing to wait for. There is nothing held back. Praise the Lord!

Blessed are the poor in spirit, Amy, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven! üôè
