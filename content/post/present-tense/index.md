Dear Amy,

What difference is made by the tense of a verb?

I have been reading again John's vision of the throne room in heaven. Just as a preliminary, let me note one thing there that always makes me smile.

{{< quote source="Revelation 4:2" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne.
{{< /quote >}}

The Creator God of the universe is enthroned, high and exalted, and John is describing what he saw.

{{< quote source="Revelation 4:3a" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian ...
{{< /quote >}}

Jasper and carnelian? Really? Come on, John, is that all you've got for us? Is that the best you can do? That tells us nothing!

And so it is, from which we may infer just how indescribable is the Lord. Beautiful beyond description. Holy beyond description. Good and wise and kind beyond description. Praise his holy name!

John continues.

{{< quote source="Revelation 4:3b-6a" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
... and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald. Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads. From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God, and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.

Regardless of the inadequacy of the description, doesn't this quicken the pulse and thrill our hearts?‚∏∫the awesome majesty of our great God!

But it's what comes next that caught my attention.

{{< quote source="Revelation 4:6b-8" url="/ref/revelation" >}}
And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight. And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say,

‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!‚Äù

Did you notice that John switched to the present tense? What he describes is happening right now! The worship in heaven is ongoing.

Join with them, Amy, and worship the holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come! üôèüôå
