Dear Amy,

What's the point of Leviticus?

I've just finished compiling a Scripture index of everything I've written to you over the last two years or so. It was really quite interesting to me! I see that I have managed to make reference to 44 out of the 66 books of the Bible, which got me thinking about those I've so far omitted. Why do I think this matters?

{{< quote source="2 Timothy 3:16-17" >}}
All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
{{< /quote >}}

The ‚Äúman of God‚Äù is a common Old Testament expression, which can refer to male or female, and indeed the NIV translates this as servant of God. It simply means us, you or me.

But, all Scripture? Including Leviticus? For us?! How could that possibly be relevant for Christians living in a post-resurrection world? Let's see.

{{< quote source="Leviticus 11:44" >}}
For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy.
{{< /quote >}}

The apostle Peter endorses its relevance.

{{< quote source="1 Peter 1:14-16" >}}
As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, ‚ÄúYou shall be holy, for I am holy.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

My study Bible summarises it like this: the book of Leviticus is concerned with what it means to be the holy people of a holy God. And what could be more relevant for us than that?

We gain insight from Leviticus into things we might otherwise overlook. What can we learn from the myriad of seemingly picky little laws that we would instinctively brush aside and not think about? Such things were clearly of great importance to the Lord. Ought we not at least to ponder why that was? These are not unrelated to those matters upon which Jesus expounded in the Sermon on the Mount, and Paul also has long lists over which we must take great care. The Lord is apparently greatly concerned about things we may be inclined to brush aside as ‚Äúdetails‚Äù.

Furthermore, to understand the sacrificial system of the Old Testament we must study Leviticus, and by this we can start to understand Jesus' own sacrifice on the cross. Why did it have to be quite so bloody? And why did he have to die such a death? Leviticus teaches us such.

{{< quote source="Leviticus 17:11" >}}
For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.
{{< /quote >}}

There is also much we can learn of God's own heart from reading Leviticus, such that as we grow in this knowledge we can more fully honour him. For example,

{{< quote source="Leviticus 19:9-10" >}}
‚ÄúWhen you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, neither shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. And you shall not strip your vineyard bare, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the LORD your God.
{{< /quote >}}

What compassion there is to be found here, what concern for the poor and for the alien. The God who gave this commandment is our God, who does not change. It turns out that the book of Leviticus is a veritable treasure trove!

As we look into it, unpacking these treasures, let us not forget the headline.

Be holy, Amy, because he is holy! üôè
