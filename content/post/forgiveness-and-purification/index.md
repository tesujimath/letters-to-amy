Dear Amy,

Here's a well loved verse from John's first letter, that we may be in danger of reading too quickly and missing the most important word.

{{< quote source="1 John 1:9" >}}
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
{{< /quote >}}

There are some important words here. Confess. Sins. And some wonderful, lifting words. Faithful. Forgive. Purify. But what am I referring to? Here's what. *Just*.

It may seem to be a little out of place, yet it is the crucial word. Consider why. Christ died on the cross, paying the price for my sin and yours, in full. If we confess our sins, and cry out to God for mercy, it is his *justice* that demands we be forgiven. The price is paid. He will not take a second payment. Rejoice, that he is faithful *and* just.
