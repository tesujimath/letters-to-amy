Dear Amy,

What does it mean to receive the kingdom of God like a little child?

What a vital question!  Jesus himself said:

{{< quote source="Luke 18:17" >}}
‚ÄúTruly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

We must fathom this then!  Let's consider three aspects of a little child's relationship with their earthly parents, and infer how to receive from our Heavenly Father.

Firstly, the little child trusts, absolutely. When the parent says it is so, or tells of something they will do, the child never doubts for a moment. The child wastes no energy at all worrying about it. They count on it, as if it were already so.

Secondly, the little child depends, completely. In fact their life makes no sense unless the parent provides, protects, cares, loves. They are wholly dependent. It is the very nature of the relationship.

Thirdly, have you ever observed a little child anticipating something to come, something wonderful, like Christmas? They are so excited! The expectation can be almost too much to bear. And as the event approaches, the excitement grows, contagiously.

Let us receive the kingdom of God like this. Our Heavenly Father is utterly reliable, and so very good. We can wholly lean on him, fully committed. He loves us deeply, has promised so much, and is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine. Could anything be more exciting?

Trust, depend, and be excited, Amy! üôè
