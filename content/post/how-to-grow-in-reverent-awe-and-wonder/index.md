Dear Amy,

So, how do we grow in reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done? Because it doesn't just happen. It takes serious get-up-early-and-cry-out-to-God hard work, every single day. Work. But not without incredible joy.

Psalm 119 helps. I won't quote it here, because, well, it's quite long. I have been including the first 32 verses in my daily readings for several years now.  (From time to time I read the whole psalm; it is worth it.)  I find these qualities in the psalmist. Earnest. Longing. Disciplined. Realistic. Falling short. Being held. Fully surrendered.

These verses conclude, "I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free."  I pray that you may increasingly run in the path of the Lord's commands like this.
