Dear Amy,

What is the nature of Jesus' love?

As we journey this week towards Good Friday, towards the cross, let's reflect on Jesus' journey towards that first Good Friday.

Jesus had just eaten his last supper with the disciples in the upper room and washed their feet, and then said something none of them expected or wanted to hear.

{{< quote source="Luke 22:31-34" url="/ref/luke" >}}
“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.” Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.” Jesus said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.”
{{< /quote >}}

Even in such a familiar passage, here is something to notice afresh. Jesus refers to Peter by his pre-Christian name, Simon. Why is that? Remember that he had previously given him a new name.

{{< quote source="Matthew 16:18" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
“And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”
{{< /quote >}}

So why does Jesus momentarily call him Simon here and then almost immediately Peter again? How interesting. Here's what I think about this. The crux is not that he initially calls him Simon, but that he then calls him Peter, and this is what Jesus wants to emphasize. Even as he is foretelling his denial, Jesus is affirming him as Peter, his chosen one, Cephas the rock. Even in his denial he is still Peter. He is still Jesus' chosen one!

Only shortly afterwards it happened just as Jesus had said.

{{< quote source="Luke 22:55-60" url="/ref/luke" >}}
And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, “This man also was with him.” But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.” And a little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, “Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.” But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.

And then what?

{{< quote source="v61a" >}}
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.
{{< /quote >}}

What would have been in that look from Jesus? Disappointment surely, and sadness⸺sadness beyond imagining⸺but also love, such love. Steadfast love. Irrefutable love. The love that would send Jesus to the cross, in obedience to his Father, love even unto death. Love for Peter.

{{< quote source="v61b-62" >}}
And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.
{{< /quote >}}

Peter realised he had denied the Lord who loved him, who had affirmed him, and who loved him still. And in his shame and wretchedness and humiliation he wept bitterly. At the time of crisis, when Jesus was going to his death, he, Peter, had been found not to be worthy. He was nothing but a shameful failure. How he wept over that failure, his failure to love Jesus as he loved him.

So where does this leave us, as we approach Good Friday? Where does it leave me? What of my own denial? Anxiety that denies Jesus as Saviour. Vestigial sin that seeks to deny him as Lord. Here's where: Jesus turns and looks at me, and he loves me. In love he stretched out his arms on that cross and died for me, and for you, Amy. I know I am not worthy of this love, but it makes no difference to Jesus. His love is irrefutable.

Such is the nature of his great love.

Remember his love for you, Amy, as we approach Good Friday, and praise him! 🙏
