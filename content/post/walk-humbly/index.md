Dear Amy,

Who is the second most humble person in the Bible?

To ask who is the most humble would be too easy!

{{< quote source="Numbers 12:3" url="/ref/numbers" >}}
Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth.
{{< /quote >}}

So then, who is the second most humble person in the Bible?

My nomination is Daniel, and since last week I have been marvelling at the evidence.

Recall that the exile to Babylon was the Lord's long awaited judgment on the Israelites for their waywardness and apostasy over so many years. They neglected to honour him and lived such compromised lives that eventually the Lord withdrew his blessing and unleashed judgment. It is sobering indeed.

But Daniel was not like that, as we have seen. His faithfulness and whole-hearted commitment to honour the Lord no matter the cost to himself must have made him feel so alienated from his compatriots. Surely? And he must have been praying so earnestly that they would repent and join him in his own journey of faithfulness and dedication. Surely? But no.

{{< quote source="Daniel 9:3-6, 8" url="/ref/daniel" >}}
Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. I prayed to the LORD my God and made confession, saying, ‚ÄúO Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules. We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.

‚ÄúTo us, O LORD, belongs open shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.‚Äù

This was being confessed by Daniel himself! What extraordinary humility and solidarity to stand with his wayward cousins and confess their sins as his own.

How was he able to do this‚∏∫something at which we ourselves often fail? I think it was because his gaze was heavenward and his eyes were fixed on the Lord that he was so aware of his own sinfulness and so uninterested in self-justification or comparisons with others. And so he simply stood alongside them. He was truly humble.

Daniel's confession continues at length. Remarkably, his cry for mercy was not for his own sake.

{{< quote source="Daniel 9:19" url="/ref/daniel" >}}
‚ÄúO Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. O Lord, pay attention and act. Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.‚Äù
{{< /quote >}}

Daniel's greatest concern was that the Lord himself was dishonoured by the shame his people bore. It's not that he had low self esteem. By no means! He simply spent no time thinking about himself. Truly he was humble.

And so he was received by the Lord with kindness and love, and visited by the angel Gabriel.

{{< quote source="Daniel 9:22-23" url="/ref/daniel" >}}
He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, ‚ÄúO Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding. At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision.‚Äù

We would do well to follow Daniel's example in every way.

{{< quote source="Micah 6:8" url="/ref/micah" >}}
He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?
{{< /quote >}}

Follow Daniel's example, Amy, and walk humbly with your God, knowing that you are greatly loved! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
