Dear Amy,

How is this life like Scooby-Doo?

Every Scooby-Doo episode I can remember ends in the same way. The mystery villain is finally unmasked by the gang and is seen to be a familiar character, who then says, ‚ÄúAnd I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!‚Äù

Paul tells a similar tale in his letter to the Ephesians.

{{< quote source="Ephesians 6:12" >}}
For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
{{< /quote >}}

What an important lesson there is here. How often life can seem so adversarial, with obstacles being put in our way by people who are frankly, just so annoying! Aargh!

If instead we can step back and regain perspective, discerning who is the real enemy and recognising that we are in the middle of a spiritual battle in the heavenly realms, the Holy Spirit will be able to equip us with everything we need to face this. That is the only way to prevail in the spiritual battle.

In the face of hostility, for example, may we respond with gentleness and kindness towards the one who is not our enemy. Hearts are healed like this, the Lord is glorified and the devil thwarted.

Is this asking too much though? How could we possibly live like this? Paul tells us how.

{{< quote source="Ephesians 6:10-11" >}}
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armour of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
{{< /quote >}}

There's clearly a bit to be said about the armour of God. For now, though, be a meddling kid and unmask the true villain!

Your struggle is not against flesh and blood, Amy, so put on the full armour of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. üôè
