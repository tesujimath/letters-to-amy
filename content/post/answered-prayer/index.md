Dear Amy,

How important is it to mind our P's and Q's in prayer?

Let's think for a moment about answered prayer, and what Paul has to say about that.

{{< quote source="Colossians 4:2" url="/ref/colossians" >}}
Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.
{{< /quote >}}

Why is it important to be watchful in prayer? Why, so we can thank the Lord for his gracious response of course! Before we can thank him we first have to notice the answer. How joyous it is to notice answer to prayer, and how it fuels our ongoing praying!

During your recent journey to and stopover in Port Moresby for your police check there were two specific things I was praying for you, Amy. Firstly for travelling mercies and safety, especially in that city which is described in the New Zealand government advice for travellers as particularly dangerous. I thank the Lord for his safekeeping of you!

The second thing I was praying most earnestly was for a ridiculously swift processing of your police check. I imagine that Papua New Guinea is a place where such things can take four months or twelve months or forever.

I know that others were praying the very same.

And what happened? It was all processed within two days! How utterly ridiculous! And what an answer to prayer!

So my follow-up prayer after ‚ÄúPlease Lord‚Äù is ‚ÄúThank you, thank you, thank you!‚Äù Thank you Lord, for your protection and provision and grace and kindness to Amy, your faithful servant. Thank you Lord! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Isn't he wonderful? Praise him!

And now what?

Let's notice what Paul wrote about a particularly low point in his life.

{{< quote source="2 Corinthians 1:8-11" url="/ref/2-corinthians" >}}
For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself. Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead. He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again. You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.

Let us not overlook quite how much we can help by prayer. We must do this! And let many give thanks for the blessing granted through these prayers!

Prayer is such a mystery, isn't it, and unanswered prayer especially so? But from time to time, like your visit to Port Moresby, we get an insight into the love and care and provision and immediacy of the Lord like a shaft of light beaming down from heaven. It is both overwhelmingly joyous and thoroughly humbling. Praise the Lord!

Give thanks, Amy, for answered prayer, and may it fuel your ongoing praying, for the Lord's own glory and the blessing of the saints! üôè
