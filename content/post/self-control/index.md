Dear Amy,

How can we travel in time, and how could that help our self-control?

{{< quote source="Galatians 5:22-23" >}}
The fruit of the Spirit is ... self-control.
{{< /quote >}}

In fact it's easy to travel in time, in our imagination. There are two vital destinations that can help us grow in self-control, especially in the face of temptation. But first, take note of this.

{{< quote source="1 Corinthians 10:13" >}}
God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.
{{< /quote >}}

We should expect to be tempted. How else will we grow in self-control other than by exercising it? So we should expect also to have to work at this. It won't be easy, obviously, since nothing worthwhile was ever gained like that. Just let us never overlook God's faithfulness in enabling us to stand.

Our first destination in time is just a few minutes into the future. Let us imagine looking back, observing our own behaviour through the lens of hindsight. Do we see someone behaving honourably? Someone displaying strength of character? Someone we are pleased to be? May the Lord's sustaining grace enable us to be that! We must be mindful that our character is defined by the accumulation of every choice that we make, no matter how small or apparently insignificant. The new viewpoint helps enormously with this!

Our second destination is a little further, at the end of our lives. Let us imagine being welcomed into heaven by our Lord. What is it that I want to hear on that day? I will live my life to hear him say this.

{{< quote source="Matthew 25:23" >}}
‚ÄúWell done, good and faithful servant!‚Äù

Do some time-travelling in your mind, Amy, and live your life to hear him say, ‚ÄúWell done, my good and faithful servant!‚Äù üôè
