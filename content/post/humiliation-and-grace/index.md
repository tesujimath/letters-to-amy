Dear Amy,

What can we learn from Matthew's shaming and humiliation of David in his genealogy? Why is he so harsh? And is there any grace to be found here?

{{< quote source="Matthew 1:1, 5-6" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

... and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David the king.

And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah.
{{< /quote >}}

Let's start with the humiliation‚∏∫David's shameful failure recorded here for all time. Notice that Bathsheba is identified but not named. Unlike Rahab and Ruth, those outsiders extraordinarily honoured by being named here, her inclusion in the genealogy isn't remotely about her. It is in fact all about David, and it's all about his most shameful failure.

David was chosen by God to be king, anointed by Samuel, and blessed by the Spirit (1 Sam 16:12-13). He was the slayer of Goliath, the Philistine champion who taunted the Israelites and defied the Lord (1 Sam 17). With humility and a grateful heart he acknowledged the greatness and kindness of the Lord (2 Sam 7), and experienced victory through him (2 Sam 8).

And then it all went horribly wrong.

{{< quote source="2 Samuel 11:1-2" url="/ref/2-samuel" >}}
In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.

It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.

You know the rest. David lusted after Bathsheba, committed adultery with her, and made her pregnant. He called her husband Uriah back from battle (where he himself should have been) and tried to get him to go home and sleep with his wife. After failing to trick that honourable man into covering his own dishonourable act, he had him murdered, and he took Bathsheba as his own wife.

{{< quote source="2 Samuel 11:27" url="/ref/2-samuel" >}}
But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

What a sobering story for anyone who thinks at all highly of themselves. Anyone so self-satisfied in their naivety and self-deception and complacency as to regard themselves as secure from falling. What a solemn warning for us all! But isn't this exactly why Matthew makes reference to this shameful deed in his genealogy?

Which of us can say we are as sold-out for the Lord as was David? Which of us has so trusted the Lord as to go up for him armed with only with a sling and five smooth stones against a nine foot giant wearing bronze armour and bearing a huge spear? Which of us has lived such a life for the Lord as his?

The truth is, we are each as prone to shameful failure as was David. It is in our sinful nature.

{{< quote source="Romans 3:22-23" url="/ref/romans" >}}
For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
{{< /quote >}}

So where is the grace?

It is right there in the very first verse.

{{< quote source="Matthew 1:1" url="/ref/matthew" >}}
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
{{< /quote >}}

Jesus identifies with such sinners as David, and with such sinners as us. See how David is honoured in this first verse. And we are honoured by Jesus' oh so costly choice to die for each one of us. He counted us worthy. He counts us worthy. It is so humbling! I weep in gratitude to my Lord and Saviour!  This gratitude together with the power of the indwelling Spirit keep me from falling.  Praise him!

God's grace is more than our most shameful failures. David shows us that. Matthew shows us. And Jesus shows us.

Rejoice, Amy, that his grace is more than enough! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
