Because I botched the formatting of Bonhoeffer's poem (sorry about that), it seemed appropriate to follow up with this as a little bonus.

> ***Changing The Past***  
>
> *The past is the past for a reason.*  
> *That is where it is supposed to stay,*  
> *But some cannot let it go.*  
> *In their heads it eats away*  
>
> *Until all their focus becomes*  
> *The person they used to be,*  
> *The mistakes they made in their life.*  
> *Oh, if only they could see*  
>
> *That you cannot change what happened,*  
> *No matter how hard you try,*  
> *No matter how much you think about it,*  
> *No matter how much you cry.*  
>
> *What happens in your lifetime*  
> *Happens for reasons unknown,*  
> *So you have to let the cards unfold.*  
> *Let your story be shown.*  
>
> *Don't get wrapped up in the negative.*  
> *Be happy with what you have been given.*  
> *Live for today not tomorrow.*  
> *Get up, get out, and start living,*  
>
> *Because the past is the past for a reason.*  
> *It's been, and now it is gone,*  
> *So stop trying to think of ways to fix it.*  
> *It's done, it's unchangeable; move on.*  
>

I'm aware of some slightly squiffy theology in this poem, and my lack of Bible references this week, but, oh well.
