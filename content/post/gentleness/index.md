Dear Amy,

What is the most Christlike response we can give to an angry, frustrated, hostile, hurting world?

{{< quote source="Galatians 5:22-23" >}}
The fruit of the Spirit is ... gentleness
{{< /quote >}}

The first thing to note about the fruit of the Spirit is that there is only one fruit (“the fruit of the Spirit _is_ ...”), and that fruit has nine characteristics. I may take nine weeks over this, let's see!

But gentleness? Why do I start here? Let's notice what Paul wrote to Timothy, his final urging in his first letter.

{{< quote source="1 Timothy 6:11" >}}
But you, man of God, flee from all this [false teaching and the love of money], and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.
{{< /quote >}}

Timothy, still young, was just starting out in ministry, but was already held in high regard by Paul, who was particularly fond of him (1 Cor 4:17, 2 Tim 1:2, Phil 2:20-22). What would we write to such a one? If we're honest, doesn't it seem a little surprising to see gentleness in that list of other more obvious qualities? It must be more important than we thought!

Again, in his final exhortations to the Philippians:

{{< quote source="Philippians 4:4-5" >}}
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.
{{< /quote >}}

The Lord is near, and what is the thing that really matters (besides rejoicing)? Our _gentleness_. It is no different than what we see in Jesus himself. See how prominent is gentleness in his characterization, both in prophecy, and by and of himself.

{{< quote source="Zechariah 9:9" >}}
Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Isaiah 42:3" >}}
A bruised reed he will not break, and a smouldering wick he will not snuff out.
{{< /quote >}}

{{< quote source="Matthew 11:28-30" >}}
“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
{{< /quote >}}

In gentleness and humility, Jesus offers a haven for the weary and burdened.

In the pressure cooker of this life, Amy, live with the gentleness of Christ! 🙏
