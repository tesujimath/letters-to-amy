Dear Amy,

We have a long race to run. How will we not grow weary and lose heart?

The writer to the Hebrews tells us exactly how.

{{< quote source="Hebrews 12:1-3" >}}
Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

How? By fixing our eyes on Jesus and considering him. Let's unpack that a bit.

Running is hard and I get tired, but by fixing my eyes on Jesus one thing is sure. I will be running towards him, always. He is the author of my story, the author of my faith, the reason that I live and the reason that I live in him. He is also the perfecter (that is completer) of my faith, sustaining me so that I can finish the race. I will not fall because ... Jesus. Because of all that he is and all that he has done.

Why did he do all this? He endured such opposition from sinful men‚∏∫those he had come to save no less! He endured the pain and humiliation of the cross, and the real agony of it all: separation from the Father. But why? Why did he do this?

We are told why he did it and how he endured: _for the joy set before him_. And what was that joy? That joy was the knowledge that he was saving you and me, Amy. That was what gave him the strength to endure the unendurable. That was his joy. His love for you and his love for me, and saving you and saving me.

Consider that! Consider him! How loved we are! How comprehensive Jesus' victory! How wonderful his love!

Consider him, Amy, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart! üôè
