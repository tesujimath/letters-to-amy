Amy is a young woman faithfully serving the Lord through a teaching ministry in a jungle village in Papua New Guinea.
These letters are sent to her each week, as a blessing and an encouragement, to remind her that she is remembered in prayer, and to encourage others to do the same.

Please pray for Amy, for her ministry, and for those for whom she is devoting this period of her life.  May the Lord she loves and serves bless her richly.
