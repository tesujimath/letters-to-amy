Amy is a young woman faithfully serving the Lord through a teaching ministry in a jungle village in Papua New Guinea.
These messages are a gift of love and encouragement sent to her each week, to remind her that she is remembered in prayer, and to encourage others to do the same.
Feel free to share them with anyone who may be similarly blessed and encouraged.

Please pray for Amy, for her ministry, and for those for whom she is devoting this period of her life.  May the Lord she loves and serves bless her richly.
