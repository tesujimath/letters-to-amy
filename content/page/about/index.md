Amy is a young woman who faithfully served the Lord for three years through a teaching ministry in a jungle village in Papua New Guinea.  She has since returned to New Zealand where she continues to serve the Lord in other contexts.

A letter to Amy was sent each week to bless and encourage, to remind her that she was remembered in prayer, and to encourage others to do the same.

The letters remain here equally to bless and encourage anyone who, like Amy, seeks to live wholeheartedly for the Lord, holding nothing back.  There are various ways in.

- the [scripture index](/ref/)
- the [topic index](/tags/)
- the [search page](/search/)
- start at [the beginning](/peace-and-provision/) and read everything in sequence

As this letter-writing ministry grew, so too did the length of the letters.

May the Lord bless you richly through these letters, which are my own offering of worship to the one whose name is Faithful and True.

If you are blessed by what you read here, know that I decided to continue writing at [O my Soul](https://omysoul.faith).

And please continue to pray for Amy and others like her.

Scripture references are quoted from the NIV in letters up to and including 14 Sep 2022, and subsequently from the ESV, unless otherwise indicated.
