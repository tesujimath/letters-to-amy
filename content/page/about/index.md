Amy is a young woman faithfully serving the Lord through a teaching ministry in a jungle village in Papua New Guinea.
A letter to Amy is sent each week to bless and encourage, to remind her that she is remembered in prayer, and to encourage others to do the same.
Feel free to share them with anyone for these reasons.

Please pray for Amy, for her ministry, and for those for whom she is devoting this period of her life.  May the Lord she loves and serves bless her richly.
