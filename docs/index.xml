        <title>The Pharisaical Heart</title>

&lt;p&gt;What breaks our Father&amp;rsquo;s heart? That would be a long list to be sure. I&amp;rsquo;ll pick one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I got to see Les Mis√©rables at the Regent. What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad ‚Äî I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears. The saddest song? Some would say I Dreamed a Dream, and that is indeed crushing (‚Äúnow life has killed the dream I dreamed‚Äù), or On My Own, √âponine&amp;rsquo;s song of unrequited love for Marius (‚Äúthe trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers‚Äù). But there is another: Javert&amp;rsquo;s soliloquy, Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javert is the policeman who pursues the protagonist Jean Valjean through the decades, after he breaks parole from a 19 year sentence of slavery for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Valjean receives unexpected grace and repents (‚ÄúI feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?‚Äù). Thus he begins a sacrificial life of love, but Javert cannot accept this. Stars is his vow to pursue Valjean and never rest until he is again behind bars. He sings, ‚Äúmine is the way of the Lord‚Äù (he is so wrong), and ‚Äúthose who falter and those who fall must pay the price‚Äù (wrong again, Javert ‚Äî Rom 8:1-4, 31-39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An isolated sad event cannot be a tragedy, no matter how heart-rending, as explained by Educating Rita&amp;rsquo;s teacher. Rather, a tragedy is the long and apparently inescapable trajectory of a life, set in motion by a particular course of events or an attitude of the heart, leading inexorably to one&amp;rsquo;s own destruction. It is the prolonged inevitability which makes it so. Javert eventually takes his own life, the only possible consequence given his Pharisaical heart, hardened over so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many today live Javert&amp;rsquo;s life, bereft of grace. Each one is a tragedy, and each one breaks our Father&amp;rsquo;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love with the Father&amp;rsquo;s love, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Changing the Past</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/changing-the-past/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/changing-the-past/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/changing-the-past/sam-rupsa-wsKtva6McZM-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Changing the Past" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I botched the formatting of Bonhoeffer&amp;rsquo;s poem (sorry about that), it seemed appropriate to follow up with this as a little bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing The Past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The past is the past for a reason.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;That is where it is supposed to stay,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;But some cannot let it go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In their heads it eats away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until all their focus becomes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The person they used to be,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The mistakes they made in their life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Oh, if only they could see&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That you cannot change what happened,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;No matter how hard you try,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;No matter how much you think about it,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;No matter how much you cry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happens in your lifetime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Happens for reasons unknown,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;So you have to let the cards unfold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Let your story be shown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get wrapped up in the negative.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Be happy with what you have been given.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Live for today not tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Get up, get out, and start living,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because the past is the past for a reason.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been, and now it is gone,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;So stop trying to think of ways to fix it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s done, it&amp;rsquo;s unchangeable; move on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Donna&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m aware of some slightly squiffy theology in this poem, and my lack of Bible references this week, but, oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who am I?</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/who-am-i/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/who-am-i/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/who-am-i/spencer-tamichi-bjH4uE6iuEo-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Who am I?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a vital question that is for any of us. It could take some time to answer! In fact, I have had to revisit it myself in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most valiant attempt I know of to grapple with this is by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor who was imprisoned in Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp by the Nazis during World War II. He was executed just one month before the end of the war. One month! He wrote the following while incarcerated. Notice that someone we might regard as a giant in the faith did not regard himself like that at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Am I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? They often tell me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I stepped from my cell&amp;rsquo;s confinement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Calmly, cheerfully, firmly,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Like a squire from his country house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? They often tell me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I used to speak to my warders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Freely and friendly and clearly,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;As though it were mine to command.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? They also tell me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I bore the days of misfortune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Equably, smilingly, proudly,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;like one accustomed to win.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I then really that which other men tell of?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Or am I only what I myself know of myself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Restless and longing and sick, like a bird in a cage,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Struggling for breath, as though hands were compressing my throat,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yearning for colours, for flowers, for the voices of birds,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Thirsting for words of kindness, for neighbourliness,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tossing in expectations of great events,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Powerlessly trembling for friends at an infinite distance,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Weary and empty at praying, at thinking, at making,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Faint, and ready to say farewell to it all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? This or the other?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Am I one person today and tomorrow another?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Am I both at once? A hypocrite before others,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And before myself a contemptible woebegone weakling?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Or is something within me still like a beaten army&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fleeing in disorder from victory already achieved?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? They mock me, these lonely questions of mine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Whoever I am, Thou knowest, O God, I am thine!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What courageously honest words, from someone facing the ultimate test of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that you are his, Amy, while you continue to work out the rest üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why is life so hard?</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/why-is-life-so-hard/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/why-is-life-so-hard/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/why-is-life-so-hard/hugo-jehanne-LOHVrTsdvzY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Why is life so hard?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is life so hard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider: the young person, to whom life seems so bleak they turn to self harm to try to anchor to reality; the older person who lives alone, who may go days without speaking with another, having long forgotten what it&amp;rsquo;s like to give and receive a hug; the faithful believer waiting on the Lord for the fulfillment of a promise, praising him in the heart-breaking years of waiting, or the one crying out for healing and enduring debilitating pain in the waiting and the praising; the grief in the death of a child. Why is life quite so very hard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this may be a consequence of trying to live apart from the Lord, or simply failing to love one another, but some is not. What of that, then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul writes about this in Romans 8:18-27, in a passage sandwiched between two rather better known and loved celebrations of victory. If you possibly can, read it in The Message. Here&amp;rsquo;s an extract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficult times of pain throughout the world are simply birth pangs. But it‚Äôs not only around us; it‚Äôs within us. &amp;hellip; These sterile and barren bodies of ours are yearning for full deliverance. That is why waiting does not diminish us, any more than waiting diminishes a pregnant mother. We are enlarged in the waiting. &amp;hellip; the longer we wait, the larger we become, and the more joyful our expectancy. (Rom 8:22-25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s much in this world that is anaesthetic. Beware! It may dull the pain, but it will also dull the joyful expectancy. Perhaps only when we bear some pain ourselves can we be of any real use in the Kingdom. It need not be our own, but then it&amp;rsquo;s not too hard to find someone else&amp;rsquo;s, and wait with them in that. These are the places where God&amp;rsquo;s grace is most evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait with joyful expectancy, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How can we love the Lord this much?</title>

        <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-can-we-love-the-lord-this-much/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-can-we-love-the-lord-this-much/nikola-jovanovic-OBok3F8buKY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How can we love the Lord this much?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we love the Lord this much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a clue in Revelation 4:8, where the four living creatures, day and night, never stop saying: ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.‚Äù  And in Revelation 5:9, where together with the twenty-four elders, they sing to Jesus, ‚Äú&amp;hellip; you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two people are in love, truly, madly, deeply, they think about each other a lot. Like, all the time! Detachment from reality may be observed. They think about each other&amp;rsquo;s attributes, the very best, and it fuels their love. David does this of the Lord in Psalm 145.  ‚ÄúEvery day I will praise you‚Äù (v2) because ‚Äúgreat is the LORD and most worthy of praise‚Äù (v3) ‚Äú&amp;hellip; and I will meditate on your wonderful works‚Äù (v5). He goes on to remind himself and us of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s attributes (v8-9, 13-14, 17-20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read these verses. Meditate on them. Dwell in them. Express your love for the Lord through them. Put him at the centre, and lift him high. Adore him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must do this day and night, never ceasing, all the time!  ‚ÄúMy mouth will speak in praise of the Lord &amp;hellip; for ever and ever‚Äù (v21).  Let us detach from the pseudo-reality that deceives us, and embrace the eternal reality. Let us feed and water our love for the Lord with endless praise, so it grows and grows, for his glory, and by his power and transforming grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love him more, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much can we love the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in church we were invited to speak out our praise to God. Woefully, every single prayer was me and us. What self-obsession! Is there any deliverance from this? Wonderfully there is, and it&amp;rsquo;s to be found in Revelation, chapters 4 and 5. Lose yourself in that for a while. Hear a hundred million angels singing, ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise!‚Äù (Rev 5:12), and every creature too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are any thinking about themselves, even for a moment? Not remotely! They are wholly captivated by the presence of the risen Lord Jesus, his glory and his power, and his irresistible love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us be so, and love the Lord with such a love that we forget ourselves. With a love for him that is magnified as he enlarges our hearts with his own overflowing love. Let us adore the one who is ‚Äúworthy &amp;hellip; to receive glory and honour and power‚Äù (Rev 4:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love him, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The truth will set you free</title>

        <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/the-truth-will-set-you-free/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/the-truth-will-set-you-free/aaron-burden-TNlHf4m4gpI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The truth will set you free" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;If you hold to my teaching &amp;hellip; then you will know the truth &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (John 8:31-32). Truth is more important now than ever, given the post-truth world in which we live, where people are inclined to define their own truth. Christians are not immune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are never more vulnerable than when we say, &amp;ldquo;the Lord told me &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;  What exactly do we mean by this? What interplay of conviction, imagination, emotion and coincidence are we leaning on? And what grounds do we have to trust any of that? We must take great care here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providentially, the Lord has told me a great deal, all of which is trustworthy and true. It was written down long ago, over 1200 pages. My best chance to grasp the truth is to read Scripture, diligently and comprehensively, with intellectual integrity and a surrendered heart, particularly when it becomes uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;If you hold to my teaching &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;  It is not enough to read. We have to do it, to live and breathe his teaching, habitually and unceasingly. Only then can we really understand, and know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;hellip; and the truth will set you free.&amp;quot; (John 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be free, Amy üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Perfect love drives out fear</title>

        <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/perfect-love-drives-out-fear/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/perfect-love-drives-out-fear/josue-michel-xCU7nCMNfI8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Perfect love drives out fear" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another observation on plain old fear, also from John&amp;rsquo;s first letter. The punchline is &amp;ldquo;perfect love drives out fear&amp;rdquo; (1 Jn 4:18), but to understand what he is saying you have to read the whole passage ‚Äî the golden rule, always!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll string some of it together. &amp;ldquo;If we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us&amp;rdquo; (v12).  &amp;ldquo;Love is made complete &amp;hellip; because in this world we are like him&amp;rdquo; (v17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What drives out fear, then? We must be Christ to one another, one relationship at a time. One conversation at a time. If we love as Christ loved us, we live in right relationship with God and with one another. Perspective is restored, and fear is dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray you may know the power of this in your own life, Amy. üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Plain old fear</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/plain-old-fear/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/plain-old-fear/simon-berger-rydQVdwcgUQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Plain old fear" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s the fear of the Lord, and there&amp;rsquo;s plain old fear, and the two are mutually exclusive. Consider plain old fear. Fear that disempowers. Debilitates. Disembowels. Fear that blinds, and blindness that feeds fear, in a downward spiral. To see how to end it, understand how it begins. It begins with lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about me (1 Jn 4:9-10). God has no use for me (Jer 29:11). God won&amp;rsquo;t keep his promises (Josh 23:14). God can&amp;rsquo;t do it (Jer 32:27). It won&amp;rsquo;t end well (Rev 21:3-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is not exhaustive. But whatever the fear, when in its grip, expose the lie which birthed the fear. Here&amp;rsquo;s that joyous verse from Psalm 119 again: &amp;ldquo;I have chosen the way of truth &amp;hellip; I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free&amp;rdquo; (v30, 32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May our Lord and Saviour continue to free your heart, Amy. üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are the Lord of all creation, majestic, sovereign, good, and wise beyond our understanding. Praise your holy name! I lift up to you the situation in Amy&amp;rsquo;s village, with Covid having arrived, and along with it, fear. Forgive us when we doubt your goodness or your sovereignty. I pray the people there would hear Jesus speaking, &amp;ldquo;Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.&amp;rdquo; (John 14:27). Please keep Amy safe and well, and may she be a beacon of hope for those who may be losing theirs, pointing to Jesus and trusting him.
üôè&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cc: Amy, with love&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forgiveness and purification</title>

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a well loved verse from John&amp;rsquo;s first letter, that we may be in danger of reading too quickly and missing the most important word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (1 Jn 1:9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some important words here. Confess. Sins. And some wonderful, lifting words. Faithful. Forgive. Purify. But what am I referring to? Here&amp;rsquo;s what. &lt;em&gt;Just&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem to be a little out of place, yet it is the crucial word. Consider why. Christ died on the cross, paying the price for my sin and yours, in full. If we confess our sins, and cry out to God for mercy, it is his &lt;em&gt;justice&lt;/em&gt; that demands we be forgiven. The price is paid. He will not take a second payment. Rejoice, that he is faithful &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; just.

        <title>How to grow in reverent awe and wonder</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-to-grow-in-reverent-awe-and-wonder/atharva-tulsi-2jA_YoQuvaA-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to grow in reverent awe and wonder" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we grow in reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done? Because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just happen. It takes serious get-up-early-and-cry-out-to-God hard work, every single day. Work. But not without incredible joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 119 helps. I won&amp;rsquo;t quote it here, because, well, it&amp;rsquo;s quite long. I have been including the first 32 verses in my daily readings for several years now.  (From time to time I read the whole psalm; it is worth it.)  I find these qualities in the psalmist. Earnest. Longing. Disciplined. Realistic. Falling short. Being held. Fully surrendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These verses conclude, &amp;ldquo;I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free.&amp;rdquo;  I pray that you may increasingly run in the path of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s commands like this.

        <title>Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</title>

&lt;p&gt;How can we know the will of the Lord? Let&amp;rsquo;s look again into the treasure trove which is Psalm 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who, then, are those who fear the LORD? He will instruct them in the ways he chooses (v12).  The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them (v14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Keller defines the fear of the Lord as this, in a sermon from Proverbs on the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom. &amp;ldquo;The fear of the Lord is a reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My prayer for you is that you learn to live this more each day.

&lt;p&gt;Here is Psalm 25:8-9 for you:  Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways. He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the therefore. Meditate on it. Revel in it. See how the Lord desires for us to be holy and blameless, and yet he does not wait for that to be so, to instruct us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path of humility is more than these two verses. It is the whole psalm. And now, I have given you one of my most precious jewels. üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience as you begin your teaching ministry there, and so that you increasingly rely on the Lord, who provides all these things [adapted from Colossians 1:9-11].

And that made me think of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBut blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.‚Äù  &amp;ndash; Jeremiah 17:7-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s monsoon season there, so enjoy the irony. Praying for you üôè&lt;/p&gt;
