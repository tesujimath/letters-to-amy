&lt;p&gt;Here is Psalm 25:8-9 for you:  Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways. He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the therefore. Meditate on it. Revel in it. See how the Lord desires for us to be holy and blameless, and yet he does not wait for that to be so, to instruct us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path of humility is more than these two verses. It is the whole psalm. And now, I have given you one of my most precious jewels. üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience as you begin your teaching ministry there, and so that you increasingly rely on the Lord, who provides all these things [adapted from Colossians 1:9-11].
üôè&lt;/p&gt;

And that made me think of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBut blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.‚Äù  &amp;ndash; Jeremiah 17:7-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s monsoon season there, so enjoy the irony. Praying for you üôè&lt;/p&gt;

Know that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s plans prevail, and &amp;hellip; he delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love. Psalm 147:11
