[{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we live confidently in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s love?\nPsalm 27 pretty much has it all. Here are the highlights. “The LORD is my light and my salvation \u0026hellip; the stronghold of my life (v1). One thing I ask from the LORD \u0026hellip; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life (v4). He will keep me safe in his dwelling \u0026hellip; and set me high upon a rock (v5). Your face, LORD, I will seek (v8).”\nConstantly reminding ourselves of these things, and living them every day, every moment, is part of it. But then out of the blue comes v9, which suddenly expresses doubt and fear of rejection. “Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, God my Saviour.”\nSuch sentiments occur throughout the Psalms, and this by the grace of God. Let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand why.\nThe Lord\u0026rsquo;s wisdom is beyond understanding, let\u0026rsquo;s first acknowledge that. He has plans and purposes, and they are good. He desires us to walk by faith, to trust him absolutely, and he loves us, ruthlessly. That\u0026rsquo;s an uncomfortable word! The walk of faith is not comfortable, nor should we expect it.\nSo while it can feel, at times overwhelmingly, like he has turned his face away and rejected us, he has not. He alone knows what he is doing, and he is deeply invested in us. That rejection is what Jesus received on the cross, so we never have to. And that is why we can assert with the Psalmist, “I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.” (v13)\nHow then can we live confidently? “Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.” (v14)\nBe strong and take heart and wait for the Lord, Amy! 🙏\n","date":"2021-07-14T06:38:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/living-confidently-in-the-lords-love/melissa-askew-8n00CqwnqO8-unsplash_hue33807f1ba953027e16a9042565de6a3_1677055_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/living-confidently-in-the-lords-love/","title":"Living confidently in the Lord's love"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat does the Lord want us to do?\nSurely there must be some special work that he\u0026rsquo;s calling us to.

Surely?\nJesus was once asked exactly this. “What must we do to do the works God requires?” Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” (John 6:28-29)\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a little enigmatic, don\u0026rsquo;t you think? Or is it? Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s actually really straightforward! What would that look like? To believe in the one the Lord has sent?\nJesus, the very Son of God, came to rescue us. From sin, and shame, and failure, and all that drags us down. From the sin that separated us from the Father. He loves us so much, that he did this completely and comprehensively, and at what cost!\nSo, to really believe in him. I am loved. I am rescued. I am free. No doubt. No fear. No shame. Only love.

Even for the Christian seeking the Lord with all of our heart, living a surrendered life, putting him first in everything, things may not turn out as we would have wished. And that\u0026rsquo;s not just small things. The whole course of one\u0026rsquo;s life could turn out to be so different from what was desired. Where is our loving heavenly father in this? Does he not want to bless his children? Absolutely he does! So what is going on?\nPaul wrote to the Romans this oft-quoted verse, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose” (Rom 8:28). Let\u0026rsquo;s consider that in the context of Solomon\u0026rsquo;s wisdom: “In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps” (Prov 16:9).\nEveryone has hopes and desires for their own life. Some may be sufficiently well organised to have a plan! But the Lord determines their steps. It is his plans and purposes that prevail. Let us not delude ourselves that we can control our own destiny, and somehow plan our way there. That is for the Lord.\nIt is important to dispel a misconception. Paul is not saying that everything that happens is good and is caused by God. That is observably false — terrible things do happen. Rather he is saying that whatever happens, God works in it and through it “for the good of those who love him”. Let us be those!\nLet us learn to see the world through the lens of Romans 8:28 as it actually is then. May we consciously receive God\u0026rsquo;s grace in all that happens. “In all things” let us submit to his superior wisdom, knowing that there is no better eternal outcome than the one he has for us. When apparent disappointments come, let us receive them with a grateful heart. The Lord has seen things that we have not. His love is unfailing. He may very well be rescuing us from something we thought was better, but is in fact not. He is the one who determines our steps, and it is very good.\nReceive his grace with a grateful heart in all things, Amy! 🙏\n","date":"2021-06-23T06:32:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/experiencing-grace/denise-jans-IJy2ZUex0-Y-unsplash_hu4e149fd970c8df355b517c83a22975b1_2547074_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/experiencing-grace/","title":"Experiencing grace"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat happens when we walk by faith?\nPerhaps the greatest example we have is Abraham. He didn\u0026rsquo;t always get it right, nor did he manage always to trust, as shown by his shabby little misdeed with Hagar. Evidently not super-human then! But the Lord called him again out of that particular failure thirteen years later, out of the absolute mess he had made (“walk before me and be blameless” - Gen 17:1), after he had been waiting for the fulfillment of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s promise to him for 25 years. Twenty-five years!\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s account in Romans 4 manages to overlook Abraham\u0026rsquo;s shameful failure (oh the grace of God!), and we find this: Yet Abraham did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised (Rom 4:20-21).\nHe believed again, and walked by faith. What then happened? He was strengthened in his faith. Notice what happened here. He believed. He exercised faith. Just enough. Perhaps barely enough, but enough all the same. And the Lord strengthened him in that faith. And it was God who was thus glorified, not Abraham.\nBut the most striking consequence is found just before this, in v18: Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations.\nNotice that little word, so. What was the reason Abraham became the father of many nations? Because he believed.\nWhen we walk by faith, God fulfills his plans and purposes in us and through us. There is a causal link. What more motivation could we have than this?\nKeep on walking by faith, Amy! 🙏\n","date":"2021-06-16T06:52:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/walking-by-faith/jimmy-larry-7uvixXrQkfw-unsplash_hu40f0a1ecf00b19a2885b7bc80528725e_3125348_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/walking-by-faith/","title":"Walking by faith"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we live confidently when the future is uncertain?\nThere are so many things we would like to know. What will I do with my life? Will it be worthwhile? How will I live? Will I be able to use the talents God has given me for his glory? Where will I go? Is my soul mate out there somewhere? Will I be alone? How can I know I will be ok? Why won\u0026rsquo;t God tell me these things?\nIn general, the Lord does not tell us such things ahead of time, and nor should we expect it. If he does reveal something, as he occasionally does, even an incredible and specific promise, it is unlikely to be how or when. What is my part then? What must I do? I must trust him, and I must live for him with my whole heart.\nRemember the first thing I wrote to you Amy, back in February, from Psalm 147:1, “The LORD delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.”\nBy choosing to trust, to walk by faith, with all of our hope in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s unfailing love, we can delight him. I will say it again. We can delight him! Without uncertainty there can be no faith, so let us embrace it, and show the Lord that we really can walk by faith. What an opportunity to show him that! There is no risk, really.

Why is this? Paul wrote to the Corinthians about his vision and the thorn in his flesh (2 Cor 12:1-10), concluding: the Lord said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me \u0026hellip; I delight in weaknesses \u0026hellip; for when I am weak, then I am strong.\nWhat does this look like?\nWhen I am judged, even when the judgment is as ignorant as it is harsh, I choose not to defend myself. How easy is it to do this? It is the hardest thing! It is dying to self. (But, my integrity is not defined by what others think of me.)\nReputation is the idol of our age, both within and without the church, maybe the greatest barrier to the gospel, to the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, and to us honouring the Lord with our whole lives. Here are the four most oppressive words, that empty us of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s power and make us utterly useless for him: what will they think?\nWhat will they think of me? I choose not to care! And here is the reason to be vulnerable, to not care about this. Suddenly I can share the gospel with great power, and absolute confidence. I am invincible, because what defines me is unassailable! (2 Cor 5:17, Col 3:3)\n“Let me reach down from my pedestal of perfection and set you on the right path, O hapless misguided sinner.” No! No! No! A hundred times no! That is the way of the Pharisee, and the Lord is not in it.\nRather, “Let me tell you of the one who rescued me”, risking the contemptuous, sneering reply, “What? Did you need to be rescued?” Yes, I did. I was rescued, am being rescued, will be rescued. It is ongoing, and I am unashamed.

That would be a long list to be sure. I\u0026rsquo;ll pick one thing.\nRecently I got to see Les Misérables at the Regent. What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad — I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears. The saddest song? Some would say I Dreamed a Dream, and that is indeed crushing (“now life has killed the dream I dreamed”), or On My Own, Éponine\u0026rsquo;s song of unrequited love for Marius (“the trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers”). But there is another: Javert\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy, Stars.\nJavert is the policeman who pursues the protagonist Jean Valjean through the decades, after he breaks parole from a 19 year sentence of slavery for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Valjean receives unexpected grace and repents (“I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?”). Thus he begins a sacrificial life of love, but Javert cannot accept this. Stars is his vow to pursue Valjean and never rest until he is again behind bars. He sings, “mine is the way of the Lord” (he is so wrong), and “those who falter and those who fall must pay the price” (wrong again, Javert — Rom 8:1-4, 31-39).\nAn isolated sad event cannot be a tragedy, no matter how heart-rending, as explained by Educating Rita\u0026rsquo;s teacher. Rather, a tragedy is the long and apparently inescapable trajectory of a life, set in motion by a particular course of events or an attitude of the heart, leading inexorably to one\u0026rsquo;s own destruction. It is the prolonged inevitability which makes it so. Javert eventually takes his own life, the only possible consequence given his Pharisaical heart, hardened over so many years.\nMany today live Javert\u0026rsquo;s life, bereft of grace. Each one is a tragedy, and each one breaks our Father\u0026rsquo;s heart.\nLove with the Father\u0026rsquo;s love, Amy! 🙏\n","date":"2021-05-26T06:46:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/the-pharisaical-heart/tamara-gore-P4mxBJtINCw-unsplash_hu46510db4cb279d99173f70d632c69551_381707_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/the-pharisaical-heart/","title":"The Pharisaical heart"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWho am I?\nWhat a vital question that is for any of us. It could take some time to answer!

Why is life quite so very hard?\nSome of this may be a consequence of trying to live apart from the Lord, or simply failing to love one another, but some is not. What of that, then?\nPaul writes about this in Romans 8:18-27, in a passage sandwiched between two rather better known and loved celebrations of victory. If you possibly can, read it in The Message. Here\u0026rsquo;s an extract.\n The difficult times of pain throughout the world are simply birth pangs. But it’s not only around us; it’s within us. \u0026hellip; These sterile and barren bodies of ours are yearning for full deliverance. That is why waiting does not diminish us, any more than waiting diminishes a pregnant mother. We are enlarged in the waiting. \u0026hellip; the longer we wait, the larger we become, and the more joyful our expectancy. (Rom 8:22-25)\n There\u0026rsquo;s much in this world that is anaesthetic. Beware! It may dull the pain, but it will also dull the joyful expectancy. Perhaps only when we bear some pain ourselves can we be of any real use in the Kingdom. It need not be our own, but then it\u0026rsquo;s not too hard to find someone else\u0026rsquo;s, and wait with them in that.

Perspective is restored, and fear is dissipated.\nI pray you may know the power of this in your own life, Amy. 🙏\n","date":"2021-04-14T06:48:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/perfect-love-drives-out-fear/josue-michel-xCU7nCMNfI8-unsplash_hu78c3b5968dbd6135aaa8b1f0e0351370_4132039_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/perfect-love-drives-out-fear/","title":"Perfect love drives out fear"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nThere\u0026rsquo;s the fear of the Lord, and there\u0026rsquo;s plain old fear, and the two are mutually exclusive. Consider plain old fear. Fear that disempowers. Debilitates. Disembowels. Fear that blinds, and blindness that feeds fear, in a downward spiral. To see how to end it, understand how it begins. It begins with lies.\nGod doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about me (1 Jn 4:9-10). God has no use for me (Jer 29:11). God won\u0026rsquo;t keep his promises (Josh 23:14). God can\u0026rsquo;t do it (Jer 32:27). It won\u0026rsquo;t end well (Rev 21:3-4).\nThis list is not exhaustive. But whatever the fear, when in its grip, expose the lie which birthed the fear. Here\u0026rsquo;s that joyous verse from Psalm 119 again: \u0026ldquo;I have chosen the way of truth \u0026hellip; I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free\u0026rdquo; (v30, 32)\nMay our Lord and Saviour continue to free your heart, Amy. 🙏\n","date":"2021-04-07T06:45:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/plain-old-fear/simon-berger-rydQVdwcgUQ-unsplash_hu438a32c2f5606ad6a78c1c1a9f97f078_4805165_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/plain-old-fear/","title":"Plain old fear"},{"content":"Dear God, my God,\nYou are the Lord of all creation, majestic, sovereign, good, and wise beyond our understanding.
