[{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat happens when we walk by faith?\nPerhaps the greatest example we have is Abraham. He didn\u0026rsquo;t always get it right, nor did he manage always to trust, as shown by his shabby little misdeed with Hagar. Evidently not super-human then! But the Lord called him again out of that particular failure thirteen years later, out of the absolute mess he had made (‚Äúwalk before me and be blameless‚Äù - Gen 17:1), after he had been waiting for the fulfillment of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s promise to him for 25 years. Twenty-five years!\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s account in Romans 4 manages to overlook Abraham\u0026rsquo;s shameful failure (oh the grace of God!), and we find this: Yet Abraham did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised (Rom 4:20-21).\nHe believed again, and walked by faith. What then happened? He was strengthened in his faith. Notice what happened here. He believed. He exercised faith. Just enough. Perhaps barely enough, but enough all the same. And the Lord strengthened him in that faith. And it was God who was thus glorified, not Abraham.\nBut the most striking consequence is found just before this, in v18: Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations.\nNotice that little word, so. What was the reason Abraham became the father of many nations? Because he believed.\nWhen we walk by faith, God fulfills his plans and purposes in us and through us. There is a causal link. What more motivation could we have than this?\nKeep on walking by faith, Amy! üôè\n","date":"2021-06-16T00:00:00Z","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/walking-by-faith/jimmy-larry-7uvixXrQkfw-unsplash_hu40f0a1ecf00b19a2885b7bc80528725e_3125348_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/walking-by-faith/","title":"Walking by faith"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we live confidently when the future is uncertain?\nThere are so many things we would like to know.

Will I be alone? How can I know I will be ok? Why won\u0026rsquo;t God tell me these things?\nIn general, the Lord does not tell us such things ahead of time, and nor should we expect it.

Why is this? Paul wrote to the Corinthians about his vision and the thorn in his flesh (2 Cor 12:1-10), concluding: the Lord said to me, ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ‚Äôs power may rest on me \u0026hellip; I delight in weaknesses \u0026hellip; for when I am weak, then I am strong.\nWhat does this look like?\nWhen I am judged, even when the judgment is as ignorant as it is harsh, I choose not to defend myself. How easy is it to do this? It is the hardest thing! It is dying to self. (But, my integrity is not defined by what others think of me.)\nReputation is the idol of our age, both within and without the church, maybe the greatest barrier to the gospel, to the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, and to us honouring the Lord with our whole lives. Here are the four most oppressive words, that empty us of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s power and make us utterly useless for him: what will they think?\nWhat will they think of me? I choose not to care!

That would be a long list to be sure. I\u0026rsquo;ll pick one thing.\nRecently I got to see Les Mis√©rables at the Regent. What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad ‚Äî I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears. The saddest song? Some would say I Dreamed a Dream, and that is indeed crushing (‚Äúnow life has killed the dream I dreamed‚Äù), or On My Own, √âponine\u0026rsquo;s song of unrequited love for Marius (‚Äúthe trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers‚Äù). But there is another: Javert\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy, Stars.\nJavert is the policeman who pursues the protagonist Jean Valjean through the decades, after he breaks parole from a 19 year sentence of slavery for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Valjean receives unexpected grace and repents (‚ÄúI feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?‚Äù). Thus he begins a sacrificial life of love, but Javert cannot accept this. Stars is his vow to pursue Valjean and never rest until he is again behind bars. He sings, ‚Äúmine is the way of the Lord‚Äù (he is so wrong), and ‚Äúthose who falter and those who fall must pay the price‚Äù (wrong again, Javert ‚Äî Rom 8:1-4, 31-39).\nAn isolated sad event cannot be a tragedy, no matter how heart-rending, as explained by Educating Rita\u0026rsquo;s teacher. Rather, a tragedy is the long and apparently inescapable trajectory of a life, set in motion by a particular course of events or an attitude of the heart, leading inexorably to one\u0026rsquo;s own destruction. It is the prolonged inevitability which makes it so. Javert eventually takes his own life, the only possible consequence given his Pharisaical heart, hardened over so many years.\nMany today live Javert\u0026rsquo;s life, bereft of grace. Each one is a tragedy, and each one breaks our Father\u0026rsquo;s heart.\nLove with the Father\u0026rsquo;s love, Amy! üôè\n","date":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/the-pharisaical-heart/tamara-gore-P4mxBJtINCw-unsplash_hu46510db4cb279d99173f70d632c69551_381707_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/the-pharisaical-heart/","title":"The Pharisaical heart"},{"content":"Because I botched the formatting of Bonhoeffer\u0026rsquo;s poem (sorry about that), it seemed appropriate to follow up with this as a little bonus.\n Changing The Past\nThe past is the past for a reason.\nThat is where it is supposed to stay,\nBut some cannot let it go.\nIn their heads it eats away\nUntil all their focus becomes\nThe person they used to be,\nThe mistakes they made in their life.\nOh, if only they could see\nThat you cannot change what happened,\nNo matter how hard you try,\nNo matter how much you think about it,\nNo matter how much you cry.\nWhat happens in your lifetime\nHappens for reasons unknown,\nSo you have to let the cards unfold.\nLet your story be shown.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get wrapped up in the negative.\nBe happy with what you have been given.\nLive for today not tomorrow.\nGet up, get out, and start living,\nBecause the past is the past for a reason.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been, and now it is gone,\nSo stop trying to think of ways to fix it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s done, it\u0026rsquo;s unchangeable; move on.\nby Donna\n I\u0026rsquo;m aware of some slightly squiffy theology in this poem, and my lack of Bible references this week, but, oh well.\nüòäüôè\n","date":"2021-05-19T00:00:00Z","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/changing-the-past/sam-rupsa-wsKtva6McZM-unsplash_huf18a06d4e2a8cf298879957e6bbc5fd3_1688029_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/changing-the-past/","title":"Changing the past"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWho am I?\nWhat a vital question that is for any of us.

Beware! It may dull the pain, but it will also dull the joyful expectancy. Perhaps only when we bear some pain ourselves can we be of any real use in the Kingdom. It need not be our own, but then it\u0026rsquo;s not too hard to find someone else\u0026rsquo;s, and wait with them in that.

Let\u0026rsquo;s look again into the treasure trove which is Psalm 25.\nWho, then, are those who fear the LORD? He will instruct them in the ways he chooses (v12). The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them (v14).\nTim Keller defines the fear of the Lord as this, in a sermon from Proverbs on the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom. \u0026ldquo;The fear of the Lord is a reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done.\u0026rdquo;\nMy prayer for you is that you learn to live this more each day. üôè\n","date":"2021-03-10T00:00:00Z","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/fear-of-the-lord-is-the-beginning-of-wisdom/greg-rakozy-oMpAz-DN-9I-unsplash_hu392a82e53b5525744bacaa1cbe4161b9_2745686_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/fear-of-the-lord-is-the-beginning-of-wisdom/","title":"Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHere is Psalm 25:8-9 for you: Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.

See how the Lord desires for us to be holy and blameless, and yet he does not wait for that to be so, to instruct us.\nThe path of humility is more than these two verses. It is the whole psalm.
