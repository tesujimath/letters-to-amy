[{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a well loved verse from John\u0026rsquo;s first letter, that we may be in danger of reading too quickly and missing the most important word.\n If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (1 Jn 1:9)\n There are some important words here. Confess. Sins. And some wonderful, lifting words. Faithful. Forgive. Purify. But what am I referring to? Here\u0026rsquo;s what. Just.\nIt may seem to be a little out of place, yet it is the crucial word. Consider why. Christ died on the cross, paying the price for my sin and yours, in full. If we confess our sins, and cry out to God for mercy, it is his justice that demands we be forgiven. The price is paid. He will not take a second payment. Rejoice, that he is faithful and just. üôè\n","date":"2021-03-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/forgiveness-and-purification/nega-YdyhHbWZ1V0-unsplash_hue9a5dbff19ca5159023d93d32187d827_497260_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/forgiveness-and-purification/","title":"Forgiveness and purification"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nSo, how do we grow in reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done? Because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t just happen. It takes serious get-up-early-and-cry-out-to-God hard work, every single day. Work. But not without incredible joy.\nPsalm 119 helps. I won\u0026rsquo;t quote it here, because, well, it\u0026rsquo;s quite long. I have been including the first 32 verses in my daily readings for several years now. (From time to time I read the whole psalm; it is worth it.) I find these qualities in the psalmist. Earnest. Longing. Disciplined. Realistic. Falling short. Being held. Fully surrendered.\nThese verses conclude, \u0026ldquo;I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free.\u0026rdquo; I pray that you may increasingly run in the path of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s commands like this. üôè\n","date":"2021-03-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-to-grow-in-reverent-awe-and-wonder/atharva-tulsi-2jA_YoQuvaA-unsplash_hu529b24a8d1cb8f3351f529a0a5b3e71a_270531_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-to-grow-in-reverent-awe-and-wonder/","title":"How to grow in reverent awe and wonder"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we know the will of the Lord? Let\u0026rsquo;s look again into the treasure trove which is Psalm 25.\nWho, then, are those who fear the LORD? He will instruct them in the ways he chooses (v12). The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them (v14).\nTim Keller defines the fear of the Lord as this, in a sermon from Proverbs on the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom. \u0026ldquo;The fear of the Lord is a reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done.\u0026rdquo;\nMy prayer for you is that you learn to live this more each day. üôè\n","date":"2021-03-10T00:00:00Z","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/fear-of-the-lord-is-the-beginning-of-wisdom/greg-rakozy-oMpAz-DN-9I-unsplash_hu392a82e53b5525744bacaa1cbe4161b9_2745686_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/fear-of-the-lord-is-the-beginning-of-wisdom/","title":"Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHere is Psalm 25:8-9 for you: Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways. He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.\nNotice the therefore. Meditate on it. Revel in it. See how the Lord desires for us to be holy and blameless, and yet he does not wait for that to be so, to instruct us.\nThe path of humility is more than these two verses. It is the whole psalm.
