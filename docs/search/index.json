[{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow many times will the Lord rescue? Isn\u0026rsquo;t once enough?\n “Because she loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue her” (Psalm 91:14)\n To be honest, my Bible actually says this:\n “Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him”\n But the gender is of no consequence. What matters is this: the pronoun is singular.\nSome think the only rescue is the body-and-blood-of-Christ one that saves us from our sin and brings us into relationship with our Heavenly Father. But that\u0026rsquo;s just the start! Notice this: “Because she loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue her”. This is someone who is already in relationship. The rescue is ongoing!\n4th July this year should have been the last day of my life. I was in Rarotonga, in a kayak, in a place I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been on that monster-surf day, caught in a rip in the Avaavaroa Passage. The waves were pounding on the exposed reef, and after ten minutes, two capsizes, and exhaustion, I knew I was going to die. I cried out to God.\n “Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him”\n A huge wave rolled in, picked me up, and carried me on the boiling white-water all the way to the inside, a hundred metres or so, to the calm water in the lagoon, with the only thought in my head being, “Why am I not capsizing? This is impossible!” And it was.\nI had been a silly boy, but there was no judgment from the Lord. All I received was this.\n “Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him”\n And so it is, regardless of whether the crisis is quite so acute as was mine, quite so physical. Perhaps the one is in community, well regarded, serving the Lord. But nevertheless captive. Oppressed.\n “Because she loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue her”\n Know this, Amy, the rescue is ongoing! 🙏\n","date":"2021-10-27T06:30:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/rescue/axel-antas-bergkvist-zrSzqDnfkQ8-unsplash_hu03402e6d13cbbfeb9899c939c8b60654_1819759_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/rescue/","title":"Rescue"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we obey a command if we don\u0026rsquo;t know what it means?\nObviously we can\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s a rhetorical question. What of this then?\n Taste and see that the LORD is good (Psalm 34:8)\n This is clearly an instruction to do something. It\u0026rsquo;s a command. Notice that David could have written, Behold! The Lord is good (because he is). That\u0026rsquo;s a true statement, but it\u0026rsquo;s not what he wrote. What he wrote, rather, is something we are commanded to do. Taste! And see! Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this.\nTasting is an action. There is something to do. Physically, we put food in our mouths and chew on it. As an aside, how gracious of the Lord to make this a pleasurable experience. We are really just refueling our bodies. Who else would have decided to make that something to enjoy? The Lord\u0026rsquo;s character is revealed even in this, that he found yet another way to bless us, his beloved. Praise him!\nThis gives us some insight. We experience the goodness of God as a result of taking some action. What action is that?\nIt seems to me that more than any other the word that appears alongside the goodness of God throughout scripture is trust, that those who would see his goodness must trust, in his unfailing love, in his mercy, in all he is and all he has done. Grab a concordance and see for yourself! This very verse continues “blessed is the one who takes refuge in him”.\nIf we would taste and see, we must then trust and depend. This makes sense. When we fully commit to depending on the Lord, such that we are not trying to control our own outcome, only then may we see the goodness of God, because only then have we left him space in which to show us that goodness. As we relinquish control over our own lives, may we learn to chew on and genuinely savour the goodness of God that he reveals to us.\nTrust and depend, Amy, taste and see, and leave the Lord space to show you his goodness! 🙏\n","date":"2021-10-20T06:33:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/taste-and-see-that-the-lord-is-good/joyful-vT5xrj3z1OE-unsplash_hu70af4556733b0a236593958d08853f16_711705_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/taste-and-see-that-the-lord-is-good/","title":"Taste and see that the Lord is good"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we relate to our Heavenly Father when he leaves our most earnest and desperate prayers unanswered?\n [Jesus said] “Ask and it will be given to you \u0026hellip; how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!” (Matthew 7:7, 11)\n“You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” (John 14:14)\n But unanswered prayer is a real thing. How can we deal with it? Many have grappled with this, and much has been written. Some have said, the Lord always answers prayer: sometimes yes; sometimes no; sometimes not yet. I find this glib and unhelpful. Because sometimes there is silence.\nImagine a husband and father, let\u0026rsquo;s call him Mark, a faithful servant of the Lord, suffering with severe health issues for so many years, for whom we have been faithfully, earnestly praying, confident that the Lord hears and is powerful to heal. Except he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and this man dies, leaving his grieving wife, Grace, and their eight-year-old son, Callum. And from the Lord, only silence. What kind of answer to prayer is that? How is that a reasonable response to desperate prayers offered from a broken heart?\nThere is another way to see this. Unanswered prayer is an invitation into relationship. An invitation into intimacy. How does this work? Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a conversation.\n You: “Why did Mark have to die? Don\u0026rsquo;t you care?”\nGod: silence\nYou: “Couldn\u0026rsquo;t you have done something?”\nGod: silence\nYou: “He loved you, didn\u0026rsquo;t he? Did you love him? You did love him, didn\u0026rsquo;t you?”\nGod: silence, then, “Yes, Amy, I loved him. I love him still.”\nYou: “What about Grace and little Callum? This is breaking my heart.”\nGod: long pause, then, “Mine too, Amy. Let\u0026rsquo;s sit together for a while.”\nintimate, healing silence\n Our Heavenly Father grieves over his broken world, and the suffering his people bear. Let\u0026rsquo;s sit with him, and grieve also, in the intimacy of his healing presence. And in the meantime,\n I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God. (Romans 8:18-21)\n Sit with the Lord in the silence of the unanswered prayer, Amy, in the intimacy of his healing presence 🙏\n","date":"2021-10-13T06:31:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/unanswered-prayer/sasha-freemind-nXo2ZsKHTHg-unsplash_hu51ddf5dc0a28d323e45054468254ef4e_1099973_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/unanswered-prayer/","title":"Unanswered prayer"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we know for sure that all we are hoping for in eternity is real, and that it will be as promised?\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m just about ready to leave this desert island, and I see a boat on the horizon (yay!), but first let\u0026rsquo;s look into Ephesians 1 for one last time.\n And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession — to the praise of his glory (Ephesians 1:13-14).\n There are some really significant points to note here.\n Are we in or out? We have been included. Most assuredly in! And not on our own merit, as if anyone could come along later and say, there\u0026rsquo;s been some mistake. No, we have been included in Christ. The power and the glory are his, and we are included, in him. We have been marked in him with a seal. When a legal contract used to be signed, both parties would sign and apply a wax seal with the impression of a signet ring, as authentication. The Holy Spirit authenticates us as children of God, the genuine article. The Holy Spirit is a deposit, that is part of the greater whole which is to follow, paid immediately, as a foretaste. There is more to come! The deposit is a guarantee of what is to come. What is to come is a certainty, and cannot be revoked. What is guaranteed is our inheritance. If we are children, then we are heirs — heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ. We are God\u0026rsquo;s possession, bought with a price, and he will never give us up. I am his and he is mine, forever. You too, Amy! The prize is our redemption, which is already accomplished, but not yet complete. One day it will be so, and we will shed off all that tires us out and drags us down. How I long for that day!  The Holy Spirit living in us not only proves our adoption by the Lord, but gives us power to live victoriously, a foretaste of what is certain, of what is promised and true. A deposit guaranteeing our inheritance!

It is not a bad place to be! Consider what Paul writes about the eyes of our heart. (The heart is the seat of life and strength, the centre of one\u0026rsquo;s will. That is mind, soul, spirit, one\u0026rsquo;s entire emotional nature and understanding.) Paul writes:\n I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength, which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms (Eph 1:18-20).\n This is a prayer. Paul asks for enlightening of the eyes of our heart. We must ask for this thing that otherwise we may miss. Notice that what the enlightened eyes of our heart do is to know. Merely seeing is curiosity. Knowing is life-changing. What is there to know? Three things.\n  Hope. My dictionary defines hope as grounds for believing that something good may happen. It\u0026rsquo;s not wishful thinking, there are actual grounds for believing this. In our context, “something good” is understated, to say the least! May the enlightened eyes of our heart know the best thing that could possibly happen.\n  Our glorious inheritance in the saints. What is this? In v3 Paul writes that the Lord “has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ”. Note the tense. Something has already happened! But what of the rest? The prophetic past tense is used throughout scripture where a future event is so certain it is written as if it had already occurred. The fulfillment of our future blessing in the heavenly realms is that certain.\n  His incomparably great power for us. This is the same power that raised Christ from the dead. It is not a small thing, and it is at work in us who believe! When we feel overwhelmed or empty, and so aware of our need for the Lord\u0026rsquo;s power and grace, perhaps his mighty strength which raised Christ from the dead will be enough. We must know this!\n  May the eyes of your heart be enlightened, Amy, in order that you may know, really know, these life changing things. 🙏\n","date":"2021-09-22T06:31:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/the-eyes-of-your-heart/javardh-FC59Au36moM-unsplash_hud074c3e2071ffe9a2e072d9c155fe27c_1166685_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/the-eyes-of-your-heart/","title":"The eyes of your heart"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s all this about predestination? Don\u0026rsquo;t people have a right to choose for themselves?\nAs I swing in my hammock on that desert island, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing much to do except read Ephesians 1. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I find.\n He chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his children through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will (v4, 5) \u0026hellip; In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory (v11, 12).\n There\u0026rsquo;s no escaping that this is the Lord\u0026rsquo;s choice, rather than mine. And that is a wonderful thing. The Lord, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, does not make mistakes. He chose me. He chose you, Amy, in accordance with his pleasure and will. As for me, I make mistakes, and my own choices are always subject to suspicion and doubt. Not so the Lord! His plans and purposes prevail, for the praise of his glory. I, you, we are both his, forever, and no mistake! And thus we have assurance of salvation.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more. He chose us to be holy and blameless in his sight. Partly that is an instantaneous, Jesus-died-for-my sins-and-now-I-am-counted-righteous thing. And partly it is a rest-of-my-life thing, as the Holy Spirit continues both to convict me and to empower me to change, as I surrender my will on the pathway to holiness. Both are life-giving, lavish gifts.\nBut what of evangelism? If people are chosen, where is repentance and belief? See what comes next in the passage.\n And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession — to the praise of his glory (v13, 14).\n Those to whom Paul writes heard the message of truth (because someone told them), and believed. Predestination does not diminish the gospel message in any way. There is undeniably mystery here, but the greatest evangelist of all time was surely \u0026hellip; Paul himself, who wrote these words.

It\u0026rsquo;s impossible to know such a one, surely, with our finite minds, with our sinful hearts. And yet, the Spirit of wisdom and revelation makes the impossible, possible.\nAs we marvel at this, let us notice that this is not a small thing Paul asks for.

The Lord had given victory to Syria through Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army (v1, how interesting), who suffered from leprosy. Previously, the Syrians had taken captives from Israel, and among them was a young girl, now a slave in the house of Naaman (v2). Not even named, and yet her faith makes her the hero of this story. How would you expect a young girl, captive in a foreign land, to live? Not like this, surely!\nShe said to her mistress, “If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy” (v3). Talk about not playing it safe and keeping your head down! What can we learn?\n She was simply and humbly living her life, a slave in Naaman\u0026rsquo;s house, with no resentment or discontent. She had a generous heart, wishing good and not harm upon her captors. She had such a conviction that through Elisha the Lord would heal Naaman the commander of the army of a hostile nation, that she was prepared to put herself on the line.  Why did she speak out like this? What trouble would have come her way if there had not been a miraculous healing? Certainly the king of Israel himself expected the outcome to be conflict between nations (v7). Her faith is ridiculous. And so she is the reason that a pagan general\u0026rsquo;s life is turned around, he becomes a worshipper of the Lord, and takes his faith back to a pagan land, into the royal palace, no less (v18).\nWe have to conclude that the Lord placed this on her heart, as he does. These were his plans and purposes, and they rested on the faith of a humble slave girl, who otherwise might simply have been living in obscurity. And on her obedience, oh my!

Let\u0026rsquo;s consider three aspects of a little child\u0026rsquo;s relationship with their earthly parents, and infer how to receive from our heavenly father.\nFirstly, the little child trusts, absolutely. When the parent says it is so, or tells of something they will do, the child never doubts for a moment. The child wastes no energy at all worrying about it. They count on it, as if it were already so.\nSecondly, the little child depends, completely. In fact their life makes no sense unless the parent provides, protects, cares, loves. They are wholly dependent. It is the very nature of the relationship.\nThirdly, have you ever observed a little child anticipating something to come, something wonderful, like Christmas? They are so excited! The expectation can be almost too much to bear. And as the event approaches, the excitement grows, contagiously.\nLet us receive the kingdom of God like this.

Personally, I doubt it was any disability, of speech or of stature, nor any severe pain to endure. Rather I suspect it was something utterly shameful and humiliating, perhaps something in his own character. Something internal and deeply personal. Why do I think this?\nIn every other respect, Paul was the elite. Highly educated. Highly disciplined. Highly capable. Zealous. Purging every sin and making every effort to live a right life (Acts 22:3, Phil 3:4-6). These are not attributes that lead to humility! They are more likely to lead to arrogance, to smug self-satisfaction, to a sense of moral superiority. How can such a one be depending completely on the Lord, and be of any use in the Kingdom?\nPaul rather was able to live with so much humility and dependence on the Lord because of this (“in order to keep me from becoming conceited”, 2 Cor 12:7), being able to say, “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners — of whom I am the worst” (1 Tim 1:15). And to live with boldness. Such boldness!\nWhen the shame of my past comes back to haunt me, to crush me, I do not deny it. I must not. The Lord lifts me, welcomes me, saves me, accepts me.

I\u0026rsquo;m quite a slow learner, and have doubted in various ways for so much of my life, but no longer. I choose therefore to believe that Jesus was telling the truth when he said this impossible thing. What do I make of it then? I have to relate it to other things I know.\nJesus said a similar thing to his disciples at the Last Supper.\n “You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” (Jn 14:14)\n But here we have the caveat, “in my name”. I can only ask for something in Jesus' name if he would have asked for the same. That\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful guideline for praying in power, and it defines my own expectation in prayer.\nSo, I choose to believe Jesus. I can\u0026rsquo;t throw a mountain into the sea, only because I cannot escape my own doubt about that. I acknowledge that as the reason. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t doubt, it would be so. That is on me. Jesus is trustworthy and true, and he speaks truth. And there are so many other things I can pray for, believing, not doubting. Impossible things, even. Praise him!\nPray in power, Amy, believing and not doubting! 🙏\n","date":"2021-08-04T06:36:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/throwing-a-mountain-into-the-sea/sulthan-auliya-WLORfDtl7oM-unsplash_hu409930a964b7fc72ec4a7a2bc840a6bf_2023129_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/throwing-a-mountain-into-the-sea/","title":"Throwing a mountain into the sea"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nCertain passages or verses in the Bible are really hard to understand. How should we approach them?\nMy intention this week was to write about telling a mountain to throw itself into the sea, not doubting. But when I looked into the context, I found that Jesus said it after cursing the fig tree on approaching Jerusalem for the last week of his life. How do we understand that? Let\u0026rsquo;s think about that first, and I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to the mountain another time.\n The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it. \u0026hellip; In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. (Mark 11:12-14, 20)\n How is this reasonable? It was not the season for figs! This seems so harsh. It is certainly hard to understand. What should we do with passages like this?\nFirstly, we ought not to anthropomorphize the tree. It was just a tree. It served a purpose, to illustrate a teaching point of Jesus. Nobody suffered in the making of this point. But still!\nThe worst comment I read about this explained that first fruits appear early, and Jesus would have expected there to be figs for that reason. But Mark would have known that, and would have said, there were no first fruits. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t the reason given! Let us not second guess the gospel writers. The Lord is responsible for his own reputation, and has no need of our defence, no need of our pitiful attempts to make him look good. Let us not brush aside these difficulties with bogus explanations.\nJesus was about to suffer and die, for the sins of all humanity. This was God\u0026rsquo;s plan, and it required rejection and brutal treatment of the Son of God by those who should have been fruitful for the Kingdom, but were not. Was the fig tree a symbol of the Jews who rejected Jesus? It was not their season to be fruitful, and they were severely judged. Is this harsh? It is a hard teaching!\nWe cannot claim perfect understanding of the mysteries of God. But as we grapple, let us do so with intellectual integrity, being faithful to Scripture, and honouring the Lord. And may we continue to love and trust him when the limits of our understanding are exceeded.\nLove and trust, Amy, and don\u0026rsquo;t stop grappling! 🙏\n","date":"2021-07-28T06:39:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/hard-teaching/maranda-vandergriff-9mqdPNk2Xwc-unsplash_hufe739519e9d947e9f891b62db9011e53_2599297_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/hard-teaching/","title":"Hard teaching"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we be expectant and not disappointed?\nLiving with high expectations of oneself and others is surely right, but can lead to ongoing disappointment, as we and those around us fall short of what we aspired to do and to be. How can the same not be true of the Lord?\nWhat should we expect of the Lord anyway? “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (Jn 10:10). “I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living” (Ps 27:13). “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them” (Mk 11:23). “Is anyone among you sick? \u0026hellip; the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up” (Jam 5:14-15). “Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him” (Ps 91:14). “You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the LORD your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed” (Josh 23:14). “I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jer 32:27). How are we not just setting ourselves up for disappointment?\nHowever we deal with this, we must never lower our expectation of the Lord. He is the Creator, Almighty, Sovereign Lord, infinite in power and wisdom. He loves us his children absolutely, and he blesses us richly and without bounds. May we never doubt that! And may we never limit our praying to what seems reasonable. If someone is sick, shame on me if I pray merely for their comfort rather than for miraculous healing.\nTo live with such expectation makes me so vulnerable, though. Vulnerable to disappointment. Vulnerable to the scorn of the sceptics. Vulnerable and defenceless. How can my faith survive this?\nRecall that Abraham was strengthened in his faith (Rom 4:20). It is a work of the Lord. I commit completely, in faith, trusting. The Lord defends me. It is miraculous grace. The heartache may remain as I wait, in that amalgam of joy and pain which characterises the Christian life as we engage with the Lord\u0026rsquo;s work in this broken world. But disappointment does not crush me, does not crush my faith. How does this work? It is a mystery, a wondrous gift of grace.\nOh my, I seem to have written another tome. Good job I do this only once a week, eh?\nLean on him, trust him for his impossible promises, and praise him for his miraculous grace, Amy! 🙏\n","date":"2021-07-21T06:45:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/expectant-and-not-disappointed/patrick-fore-T2S4CatGdfQ-unsplash_hu28680808206838e20d8e3310d9dd6ad4_2090984_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/expectant-and-not-disappointed/","title":"Expectant and not disappointed"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we live confidently in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s love?\nPsalm 27 pretty much has it all.

One thing I ask from the LORD \u0026hellip; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life (v4). He will keep me safe in his dwelling \u0026hellip; and set me high upon a rock (v5). Your face, LORD, I will seek (v8).”\nConstantly reminding ourselves of these things, and living them every day, every moment, is part of it. But then out of the blue comes v9, which suddenly expresses doubt and fear of rejection. “Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, God my Saviour.”\nSuch sentiments occur throughout the Psalms, and this by the grace of God. Let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand why.\nThe Lord\u0026rsquo;s wisdom is beyond understanding, let\u0026rsquo;s first acknowledge that. He has plans and purposes, and they are good. He desires us to walk by faith, to trust him absolutely, and he loves us, ruthlessly. That\u0026rsquo;s an uncomfortable word! The walk of faith is not comfortable, nor should we expect it.\nSo while it can feel, at times overwhelmingly, like he has turned his face away and rejected us, he has not. He alone knows what he is doing, and he is deeply invested in us. That rejection is what Jesus received on the cross, so we never have to. And that is why we can assert with the Psalmist, “I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.” (v13)\nHow then can we live confidently? “Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.” (v14)\nBe strong and take heart and wait for the Lord, Amy! 🙏\n","date":"2021-07-14T06:38:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/living-confidently-in-the-lords-love/melissa-askew-8n00CqwnqO8-unsplash_hueb81d7083a86971b0dc3c3b1536b2599_1615847_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/living-confidently-in-the-lords-love/","title":"Living confidently in the Lord's love"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat does the Lord want us to do?\nSurely there must be some special work that he\u0026rsquo;s calling us to.

Even for the Christian seeking the Lord with all of our heart, living a surrendered life, putting him first in everything, things may not turn out as we would have wished. And that\u0026rsquo;s not just small things. The whole course of one\u0026rsquo;s life could turn out to be so different from what was desired. Where is our loving heavenly father in this? Does he not want to bless his children? Absolutely he does! So what is going on?\nPaul wrote to the Romans this oft-quoted verse, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose” (Rom 8:28). Let\u0026rsquo;s consider that in the context of Solomon\u0026rsquo;s wisdom: “In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps” (Prov 16:9).\nEveryone has hopes and desires for their own life. Some may be sufficiently well organised to have a plan! But the Lord determines their steps. It is his plans and purposes that prevail. Let us not delude ourselves that we can control our own destiny, and somehow plan our way there. That is for the Lord.\nIt is important to dispel a misconception. Paul is not saying that everything that happens is good and is caused by God. That is observably false — terrible things do happen. Rather he is saying that whatever happens, God works in it and through it “for the good of those who love him”. Let us be those!\nLet us learn to see the world through the lens of Romans 8:28 as it actually is then. May we consciously receive God\u0026rsquo;s grace in all that happens. “In all things” let us submit to his superior wisdom, knowing that there is no better eternal outcome than the one he has for us. When apparent disappointments come, let us receive them with a grateful heart. The Lord has seen things that we have not. His love is unfailing. He may very well be rescuing us from something we thought was better, but is in fact not. He is the one who determines our steps, and it is very good.\nReceive his grace with a grateful heart in all things, Amy! 🙏\n","date":"2021-06-23T06:32:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/experiencing-grace/denise-jans-IJy2ZUex0-Y-unsplash_hu4e149fd970c8df355b517c83a22975b1_2547074_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/experiencing-grace/","title":"Experiencing grace"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat happens when we walk by faith?\nPerhaps the greatest example we have is Abraham. He didn\u0026rsquo;t always get it right, nor did he manage always to trust, as shown by his shabby little misdeed with Hagar. Evidently not super-human then! But the Lord called him again out of that particular failure thirteen years later, out of the absolute mess he had made (“walk before me and be blameless” - Gen 17:1), after he had been waiting for the fulfillment of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s promise to him for 25 years. Twenty-five years!\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s account in Romans 4 manages to overlook Abraham\u0026rsquo;s shameful failure (oh the grace of God!), and we find this: Yet Abraham did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised (Rom 4:20-21).\nHe believed again, and walked by faith. What then happened? He was strengthened in his faith. Notice what happened here. He believed. He exercised faith. Just enough. Perhaps barely enough, but enough all the same. And the Lord strengthened him in that faith. And it was God who was thus glorified, not Abraham.\nBut the most striking consequence is found just before this, in v18: Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations.\nNotice that little word, so.

What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad — I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears. The saddest song? Some would say I Dreamed a Dream, and that is indeed crushing (“now life has killed the dream I dreamed”), or On My Own, Éponine\u0026rsquo;s song of unrequited love for Marius (“the trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers”). But there is another: Javert\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy, Stars.\nJavert is the policeman who pursues the protagonist Jean Valjean through the decades, after he breaks parole from a 19 year sentence of slavery for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Valjean receives unexpected grace and repents (“I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?”). Thus he begins a sacrificial life of love, but Javert cannot accept this. Stars is his vow to pursue Valjean and never rest until he is again behind bars. He sings, “mine is the way of the Lord” (he is so wrong), and “those who falter and those who fall must pay the price” (wrong again, Javert — Rom 8:1-4, 31-39).\nAn isolated sad event cannot be a tragedy, no matter how heart-rending, as explained by Educating Rita\u0026rsquo;s teacher. Rather, a tragedy is the long and apparently inescapable trajectory of a life, set in motion by a particular course of events or an attitude of the heart, leading inexorably to one\u0026rsquo;s own destruction. It is the prolonged inevitability which makes it so. Javert eventually takes his own life, the only possible consequence given his Pharisaical heart, hardened over so many years.\nMany today live Javert\u0026rsquo;s life, bereft of grace.

Why is life quite so very hard?\nSome of this may be a consequence of trying to live apart from the Lord, or simply failing to love one another, but some is not. What of that, then?\nPaul writes about this in Romans 8:18-27, in a passage sandwiched between two rather better known and loved celebrations of victory. If you possibly can, read it in The Message. Here\u0026rsquo;s an extract.\n The difficult times of pain throughout the world are simply birth pangs. But it’s not only around us; it’s within us. \u0026hellip; These sterile and barren bodies of ours are yearning for full deliverance. That is why waiting does not diminish us, any more than waiting diminishes a pregnant mother. We are enlarged in the waiting. \u0026hellip; the longer we wait, the larger we become, and the more joyful our expectancy. (Rom 8:22-25)\n There\u0026rsquo;s much in this world that is anaesthetic. Beware! It may dull the pain, but it will also dull the joyful expectancy. Perhaps only when we bear some pain ourselves can we be of any real use in the Kingdom. It need not be our own, but then it\u0026rsquo;s not too hard to find someone else\u0026rsquo;s, and wait with them in that.

Like, all the time! Detachment from reality may be observed. They think about each other\u0026rsquo;s attributes, the very best, and it fuels their love. David does this of the Lord in Psalm 145. “Every day I will praise you” (v2) because “great is the LORD and most worthy of praise” (v3) “\u0026hellip; and I will meditate on your wonderful works” (v5). He goes on to remind himself and us of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s attributes (v8-9, 13-14, 17-20).\nRead these verses. Meditate on them. Dwell in them. Express your love for the Lord through them. Put him at the centre, and lift him high. Adore him.\nWe must do this day and night, never ceasing, all the time! “My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord \u0026hellip; for ever and ever” (v21). Let us detach from the pseudo-reality that deceives us, and embrace the eternal reality. Let us feed and water our love for the Lord with endless praise, so it grows and grows, for his glory, and by his power and transforming grace.\nLove him more, Amy! 🙏\n","date":"2021-05-05T06:45:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-can-we-love-the-lord-this-much/nikola-jovanovic-OBok3F8buKY-unsplash_hu42faa3416fccaaa9a99fce5c7b3b3305_1732135_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-can-we-love-the-lord-this-much/","title":"How can we love the Lord this much?"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow much can we love the Lord?\nRecently in church we were invited to speak out our praise to God. Woefully, every single prayer was me and us. What self-obsession! Is there any deliverance from this? Wonderfully there is, and it\u0026rsquo;s to be found in Revelation, chapters 4 and 5. Lose yourself in that for a while. Hear a hundred million angels singing, “Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise!” (Rev 5:12), and every creature too.\nAre any thinking about themselves, even for a moment? Not remotely! They are wholly captivated by the presence of the risen Lord Jesus, his glory and his power, and his irresistible love.\nLet us be so, and love the Lord with such a love that we forget ourselves. With a love for him that is magnified as he enlarges our hearts with his own overflowing love.

Truth is more important now than ever, given the post-truth world in which we live, where people are inclined to define their own truth. Christians are not immune.\nWe are never more vulnerable than when we say, \u0026ldquo;the Lord told me \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; What exactly do we mean by this? What interplay of conviction, imagination, emotion and coincidence are we leaning on? And what grounds do we have to trust any of that?
