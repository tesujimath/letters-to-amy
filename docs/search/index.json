[{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhere does discouragement come from and what can we do about it?\nThe truth is, discouragement can sneak in at any time and begin its insidious work of erosion of faith and joy. Perhaps all we notice is being a little flat, a little down. Why does this happen, and why does it sometimes happen so suddenly?\nThere are many and varied reasons.\nSometimes the reasons are obvious: prolonged waiting, for healing, for deliverance, for the fulfillment of a promise; or fatigue, especially post-mission fatigue, when a work has been completed‚∏∫perhaps when a young and enthusiastic team leaves after a significant and high energy visit and all the energy seems to leave with them. And sometimes the reasons are less obvious and there is simply an absence of waypoints upon which to pin hope, or merely a nagging sense that we have dropped off other people\u0026rsquo;s radar and there is no-one to notice whether we are flourishing or fading.\nThe question is, what to do? Paul knew.\nFor I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God\u0026rsquo;s mystery, which is Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\n‚Äï Colossians 2:1-3 The truth is, we all need encouragement from our brothers and sisters in Christ. The journey of faith is not a solitary one. Our hearts are encouraged as we are knit together in love, one with another, but more than this. What could be more encouraging than to be reminded of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge which are in Jesus and which are Jesus? To hear ‚Äúcheer up‚Äù is of such limited comfort. But to hear ‚ÄúJesus is interceding for you at the right hand of the Father, even now‚Äù lifts me.\nAs you look ahead to your last few months in the village, Amy, know that the work you have been doing and the work that you will complete before you leave is of eternal significance. Not only is Jesus himself interceding for you, but together with the Father he is so pleased to see you completing your faithful service, persevering even when it is hard and there is no-one to say well done. So pleased with you. And so I say it now: well done, Amy!\nI have one last insight for you, for sometimes when we need to hear such words of encouragement there is no-one speaking them to us. What then?\nConsider how Paul regarded the Thessalonians, who were so dear to him.\nFor what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? For you are our glory and joy.\n‚Äï 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 Sometimes we long for a word of encouragement, and it does not come. So then we must speak it to another, affirm and encourage them in the Lord, and find in that, as Paul did, glory and joy.\nWith much love and encouragement to you, Amy, as you continue on in your faithful work for the Lord! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2023-07-19T06:15:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/discouragement/from-marwool-X-Z9gHq6iow-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_1127295_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/discouragement/","title":"Discouragement"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nDo you ever marvel at how the Bible is quite so dense with blessing and encouragement, and that even the most familiar passages can suddenly reveal to us new insight and bestow upon us new grace?\nLet me give you an example, just half a verse, a mere seven words.\nDwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.\n‚Äï Psalm 37:3b On the face of it this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be saying very much at all. What does ‚Äúdwell in the land‚Äù even mean? Is it simply saying, live your life? By no means!\nTo understand this we must understand the Old Testament significance of the land from the very beginning, from the call of Abraham, even before God gave him his new name which means ‚Äúfather of a multitude‚Äù.\nNow the LORD said to Abram, ‚ÄúGo from your country and your kindred and your father\u0026rsquo;s house to the land that I will show you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTo your offspring I will give this land.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 12:1, 7 (Be mindful that this promise was spoken to a childless 75 year old man who was married to a barren woman.)\nMore was revealed when God spoke to Moses out of the burning bush.\nThen the LORD said, ‚ÄúI have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.\n‚Äï Exodus 3:7-8 This was ‚Äúthe land‚Äù and it was hugely symbolic of the covenant promise of the Lord to Abraham and to his chosen people, the Israelites. To dwell in the land then is to live in the promises of God‚∏∫the promises of the most faithful God to his woefully unfaithful people.\nAnd ‚Äúbefriend faithfulness‚Äù? The Lord himself is faithfulness personified. We befriend faithfulness by honouring him with our own faithfulness, trusting not doubting his promises to us.\nWhat are these promises? Some are common to us all‚∏∫Scripture is full of them! One of the most astonishing is in the very next verse, and we already considered this extravagant promise, seemingly too good to be true.\nDelight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart.\n‚Äï Psalm 37:4 Seek the Lord with all of your heart, desiring him alone, and he will give himself to you in the richest of relationship. This extraordinary promise is that we can have as much of the Lord in our lives as we desire. Praise his holy name!\nAnd some promises are uniquely given. Promises that I have received are for me, and different from yours, Amy. We honour him alike by resting in these promises, living in them expectantly, believing not doubting, just as David goes on.\nCommit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act.\n‚Äï Psalm 37:5 The Lord is not uninvolved as we live in his promises. Trust in him and he will act, whatever has been promised!\nDwell in the land, Amy, and befriend faithfulness! üôè\n","date":"2023-07-12T06:15:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/dwelling-in-the-land/leonard-cotte-c1Jp-fo53U8-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_3949589_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/dwelling-in-the-land/","title":"Dwelling in the land"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the principle of reciprocity in relationship?\nFor I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you‚∏∫that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other\u0026rsquo;s faith, both yours and mine.\n‚Äï Romans 1:11-12 Paul wrote these words to the Christians in Rome before he ever met them. Marvel at the warmth in his longing to see them, his desire to bless, and that they might share mutual encouragement, each to the other, even on meeting for the first time. Such is the love a Christian has for their brothers and sisters in Christ.\nBy now those on the DCBC youth mission trip will be with you, and some of these you may be meeting for the first time: Abigail, Alexia, Blake, Emma, Hannah, Jack, Zac, Taylor, and Aria (although I notice that one of these you have known for her whole life!). We have been praying for safety and travelling mercies and the richest of blessings, lifting you and them both up before our loving Heavenly Father. Now be encouraged, each to the other, by each other\u0026rsquo;s faith and every spiritual blessing in Christ. And have some fun together!\nReciprocity is about giving and receiving simultaneously, imparting blessing and being blessed, symmetrically and joyously together. Every relationship is deepened by this: husband and wife, parent and child, teacher and student, boss and employee, and most especially brother and sister in Christ.\nPaul knew this, and even as he desired to bring blessing and teaching to those new Christians in Rome, he was anticipating receiving blessing and encouragement in return. The huge difference in maturity and degree of experience simply did not matter. How joyous is genuine Christian fellowship!\nWhenever Christians come together, however, there is a potential barrier to such reciprocity in relationship, namely one taking the superior position, looking down on the other as somehow poorer or otherwise less than, to be solely the recipient rather than also the source of blessing. Let\u0026rsquo;s remind ourselves how Paul regarded Timothy to see how to avoid this.\nTimothy was indeed young to be in Christian leadership, perhaps in his late 20s or early 30s, and there was a huge gulf between their levels of experience and capability. Paul was much older, was so much more highly educated, and ended up writing more than half of the New Testament, but see how highly he regarded Timothy.\nFor I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. But you know Timothy\u0026rsquo;s proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel.\n‚Äï Philippians 2:20-22 And his charge to Timothy himself:\nLet no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.\n‚Äï 1 Timothy 4:12 To finish, I cannot help myself from giving you the mathematical definition of a reciprocal: of a quantity or function, related to another so that their product is unity.\nBe one, Amy, with your younger brothers and sisters in Christ, and may you bring blessing and encouragement each to the other! üôè\n","date":"2023-07-05T06:15:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/reciprocity/duy-pham-Cecb0_8Hx-o-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_2970775_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/reciprocity/","title":"Reciprocity"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can those made in the image of God be transformed into his image? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that a bit, well, circular?\nAnd we all, with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 3:18 In this chapter Paul is contrasting the old and new covenants, characterising the old covenant as ‚Äúthe ministry of death‚Äù (v7) and ‚Äúthe ministry of condemnation‚Äù (v9), oh my! What do we need to know to understand what he writes here?\nOur hope in the new covenant is in the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness‚∏∫our righteousness in Christ, purchased at such great cost‚∏∫a permanent glory (v8-11). In contrast, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, while his face initially shone with the reflected glory of the Lord, he covered himself with a veil so that the Israelites would not see how quickly it faded (Exodus 34:29-35).\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s follow Paul\u0026rsquo;s reasoning.\nSince we have such a hope, we are very bold, not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end. But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 3:12-17 Those who live under the old covenant live with a veil over their hearts to cover the shame of failing to live up to what is required, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23).\nWhy then are we so bold? Because we stand in Christ\u0026rsquo;s righteousness, not our own. Hallelujah! Our faces are unveiled because there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). Only through Christ is the veil taken away. No condemnation. No fear. No shame. Freedom is ours! Praise the Lord!\nAnd so we, the rescued ones, beloved of God, are being transformed from one degree of glory into another. What we were created to be has not yet been seen in our lives. Assuredly we were made in the image of God, but that became so tarnished by sin, by that rebellion against God passed down through the ages from the first man and the first woman. There is, however, such a joyous anticipation in the ongoing process of sanctification, of being made holy, through which we will be made into that which we were always meant to be. And get this: we ourselves are fully a part of that process.\nFor in his great wisdom, in the mystery of his marvellous ways, the Lord chooses to involve us in that transformation. It comes when we surrender our will to the Holy Spirit, and when we do, how it comes! Look at the lovely way that Paul describes those who are being transformed.\nAnd you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.‚Å†\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 3:3 Know that you are a letter from Christ, Amy, written on the tablet of your own heart, a witness before the nations to his great love and mercy and grace and his power to transform into his own likeness! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2023-06-28T06:15:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/from-glory-to-glory/joshua-j-cotten-dMn92oICKFY-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_3640733_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/from-glory-to-glory/","title":"From glory to glory"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow do you untangle a Gordian knot?\nPerhaps you know the legend of the knot so complex and tangled, for which the one who released it would be bestowed with glory and honour? Alexander the Great famously drew his sword and sliced it apart.\nFor the problems we face in life, or the problems faced by those we know‚∏∫problems so complex and tangled that they are utterly beyond us, intractable problems, Gordian problems‚∏∫shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we expect the Lord simply to slice them apart triumphantly as did Alexander? Why does he not do this?\nWhat do we find instead? That the Lord\u0026rsquo;s response to our prayers, his mighty work of great power, is so painfully slow that we can barely see headway. How can our faith withstand this? How can we endure the waiting, the ongoing nature of such a problem?\nCould there be another way to see this?\nPeter tells us straightforwardly what we should expect.\nBut do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\n‚Äï 2 Peter 3:8 Oh dear. In the light of this verse I remember chuckling self-deprecatingly to myself that all my problems would be sorted out in a couple of days. God time is slow, slow, slow time. Isn\u0026rsquo;t the waiting simply infuriating?\nThere are three observations that enable us to endure.\nFirstly, let\u0026rsquo;s notice that Peter addresses his readers as beloved. That\u0026rsquo;s us! We are beloved of the Lord, and whatever the situation and no matter how long the waiting, we must not forget that. Notice the tenderness and understanding here, as Peter articulates that the wait may be prolonged. The Lord is not oblivious of nor indifferent to our pain in the waiting.\nSecondly, let\u0026rsquo;s notice that Alexander the Great was in fact a brutal warlord who left in his wake death and destruction. Slicing through the knot in the way that he did reflects who he was. The Lord is so completely not like this. Consider the very next verse.\nThe Lord is not slow to fulfil his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.\n‚Äï 2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is so unlike the brutal warlord. With infinite patience and painstaking attention to detail, he unpicks and untangles the most intractable problems in our lives, with such gentleness and amazing kindness, prepared to take as long as is necessary, not wishing that any should perish but that all should reach repentance. It is not slowness at all. It is in fact gentleness and kindness and meticulous restoration.\nThirdly and finally, let\u0026rsquo;s notice the symmetry in Peter\u0026rsquo;s characterisation: with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. For sure, some things take such a long time, and we struggle to understand why this would be so. But for others or even for these at just the right time, in a moment, in a twinkling of the eye, the Lord does his work of great power and quite suddenly everything is different. Praise the Lord!\nLeave the Gordian problems to the Lord, Amy, and trust that with infinite patience, gentleness and kindness and great power, he knows just what to do! üôè\n","date":"2023-06-21T06:15:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/gordian-problems/gordian-knot-coin_hu900082e07fc4f6a1a50a2903a26cbe81_123058_120x120_fill_q75_h2_box_smart1_2.webp","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/gordian-problems/","title":"Gordian problems"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat exactly is this holiness to which we are called?\nPerhaps we have some idea that it is about purity and being set apart for God, but how easy it is to misunderstand what this means. To make a generalisation, the Pharisees, as earnest as anyone has ever been in their desire to honour the Lord, so failed to understand what was required here that their very lives became an offence in God\u0026rsquo;s nostrils.\nMy Bible dictionary includes in its definition ‚Äúmoral and ethical wholeness‚Äù. We would do well however to consider what the Bible itself has to say. Leviticus Chapter 19 in its entirety is going to help us.\nAnd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, ‚ÄúSpeak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy. Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, and you shall keep my Sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves any gods of cast metal: I am the LORD your God.‚Äù\n‚Äï Leviticus 19:1-4 Holiness is very much about what we do and that what we do honours the Lord, his laws, and his precepts. But it is so much more than this, some of which we have seen already.\n‚ÄúWhen you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, neither shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. And you shall not strip your vineyard bare, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the LORD your God.‚Äù\n‚Äï Leviticus 19:9-10 Holiness is also about protection and provision for the weak and the vulnerable. The Lord has a heart for such as these, and so must we if we are to be a holy people.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s more.\n‚ÄúYou shall not oppress your neighbour or rob him. The wages of a hired worker shall not remain with you all night until the morning.‚Äù\n‚Äï Leviticus 19:13 How interesting. In a chapter on holiness, we find specific instruction that we are not to wield power over others. The hired worker is at the mercy of the one who hires him, and holiness demands that mercy be shown.\nAnd then we get onto some aspects of holiness which may be somewhat surprising, but nevertheless must be understood.\n‚ÄúYou shall not let your cattle breed with a different kind. You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, nor shall you wear a garment of cloth made of two kinds of material.‚Äù\n‚Äï Leviticus 19:19 Oh wow! How arbitrary and irrelevant does this sound to 21st Century ears? And yet it is absolutely relevant. How so?\nThe principle here is that God\u0026rsquo;s holy people, called and set apart, must never become compromised by those among whom they live. How easily do we tend towards assimilation into the practices and morality of the day. May it never be so! See how this is underlined with specific examples next.\n‚ÄúYou shall not round off the hair on your temples or mar the edges of your beard. You shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead or tattoo yourselves: I am the LORD.‚Äù\n‚Äï Leviticus 19:27-28 These were practices of the Canaanite pagans. As prohibitions they certainly sound strange to us in these modern times, so we must reframe them. Let\u0026rsquo;s not overlook how modern pagans pipe profanity and blasphemy and lewdness directly into their living rooms via streaming television (well, perhaps not in your village, Amy!), how strangers in society are dehumanised and ostracised, how social media have displaced actual relationship, how loneliness has become normalised, how brazenly are idols pursued‚∏∫career, success, family, respectability. In the face of all these we must remain holy, and holiness means they must be repudiated.\nAnd finally these:\n‚ÄúYou shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the LORD.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.‚Äù\n‚Äï Leviticus 19:18, 34 An outworking of holiness is love itself. This should not surprise us because love is the essence of moral and ethical wholeness, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? And so holiness can be understood as an attitude of the heart that completely and comprehensively honours the Lord and which is outworked both in our internal thought lives and in our external behaviour in every aspect of our lives, without compromise.\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t holiness seem to cover so much? My favourite theologian summarises it like this.\nChristian holiness is a number of things together. It has both outward and inward aspects. Holiness is a matter of both action and motivation, conduct and character, divine grace and human effort, obedience and creativity, submission and initiative, consecration to God and commitment to people, self-discipline and self-giving, righteousness and love.\n‚Äï J.I. Packer, A Passion for Holiness, Chapter 1 You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.\n‚Äï Leviticus 19:2 May love and holiness be the defining characteristics of all of our lives, Amy! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2023-06-14T06:15:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-nature-of-holiness/luke-stackpoole-5Qqkjn4PFPA-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_6338624_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-nature-of-holiness/","title":"The nature of holiness"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nAre you holy?\nWhy do I dare to ask such a confronting question? In fact it\u0026rsquo;s not my own. The question belongs to J.C. Ryle, and was first asked in 1887.\nFor one thing, let me ask everyone who may read these pages, Are you holy?\nI do not ask whether you attend church regularly, whether you have been baptized and receive the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Supper, or whether you call yourself a Christian; I ask something more than this: Are you holy, or are you not?\nI do not ask \u0026hellip; whether you want to be holy and hope you will be holy some day. I ask something more than this: Are you yourself holy this very day, or are you not?\nWhy do I ask so directly and so strongly? I do it because the Bible says that without holiness, no one will see the Lord.\n‚Äï J.C. Ryle, Holiness, Chapter 3 It is an uncomfortable question to be sure but a vital one, and one which I ask myself from time to time. There is enormous value in asking this question. Why is that? Not only because our personal holiness is so important, but because the question itself shows us the way to holiness.\nHow can such a question show the way? Simply because when I ask this of myself, certain things may suddenly and vividly spring into the forefront of my mind‚∏∫things in my life that seek to deny that I am holy. What a revelation! These are precisely the things that need to be purged from my life, biffed out, put to death. Or things not in my life that need to be. Those must come in.\nSo, am I holy?\nWhat a remarkably simple and straightforward and practical way to know how to live a holy life, don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\nRyle is quoting here from the letter to the Hebrews, just after the cloud of witnesses and running with perseverance and the Lord\u0026rsquo;s discipline of his sons and daughters.\nTherefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.\n‚Äï Hebrews 12:12-14 Beware the pernicious lie that lurks in our subconscious which we must deal with‚∏∫that living with such holiness is entirely beyond us, and it is unrealistic to aspire to such a thing. Repudiate the lie! It is Satan\u0026rsquo;s utmost desire that we swallow it. Jesus warns us.\nHe was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\n‚Äï John 8:44 What then is the truth? Paul tells us.\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:3-4 Each one of us was chosen by our Heavenly Father before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. He is ambitious to achieve his plans and purposes for and in each one of us!

So why is it that I am wanting to further distil this? Simply so we may grasp with crystal clarity what it really means to live our lives in a way which honours him absolutely.\nWe have already seen that love is the most important thing‚∏∫love for the Father and love for Jesus, followed by love for one another.\nAnd one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, ‚ÄúWhich commandment is the most important of all?‚Äù Jesus answered, ‚ÄúThe most important is, ‚ÄòHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.‚Äô The second is this: ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbour as yourself.‚Äô There is no other commandment greater than these.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 12:28-31 One side of the coin is simply inscribed love.\nAnd the other side?\nAnd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, ‚ÄúSpeak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.‚Äù\n‚Äï Leviticus 19:1-2 The other side of the coin is inscribed holiness. Love and holiness. Two sides of the same coin in fact. How so? Jesus tells us.\n‚ÄúIf you love me, you will keep my commandments.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 14:15 So our personal holiness must be a consequence of love. Our motivation to live with holiness must be love for the Lord, our utmost desire to honour him. There is no other way to live like this victoriously in his power and by his grace. And in this there can be no pretending.\n‚ÄúAnd you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.\n‚Äï 1 Chronicles 28:9 The Hebrew word here is y√™tser, which means intent. He understands every intent of the thoughts. Every motive. This is both confronting and liberating. Confronting obviously. But liberating because when we stumble, which we do because that is part of what it means to be human, he understands the motive behind the thoughts. If my deepest desire is to honour my Heavenly Father, he knows this, and my stumbles are easily forgiven as simply that.\nLove and holiness‚∏∫this is what must define us if we are to bring him glory, fulfil his mission for us, and change the world. And this too is what must define our church if we are to have any relevance in a broken and hurting world.\nSo each morning I awake, I resolve to honour the Lord this very day through the love and holiness of my life. It is my offering of worship to him, and it is joyous.\nPursue love and holiness, Amy, with ruthless consistency and great joy! üôè\n","date":"2023-05-31T06:15:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/love-and-holiness/kanchanara-7E3QGntO66M-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_4180483_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/love-and-holiness/","title":"Love and holiness"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow debilitating is doubt?\nDoubt is insidious.

Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\n‚Äï Mark 11:23-24 We have considered this promise before and understood the caveats of praying in Jesus\u0026rsquo; name only what pleases him. But we can do this! We are sons and daughters of the living God, adopted into his family and living as slaves to righteousness. We can pray such prayers!\nWhy then would we not pray them confidently and with expectation?\nWhen Jesus taught his disciples the Lord\u0026rsquo;s prayer, he followed up with an illustration of going to disturb a friend at midnight to ask for bread.\nI tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs.\n‚Äï Luke 11:8 The word translated in the ESV as impudence appears in some translations as persistence, and perhaps that is more familiar. But the Greek word is anaideia, and impudence or even shamelessness is the more accurate translation‚∏∫indeed the NIV 2011 has ‚Äúshameless audacity‚Å†‚Äù. The asking is so relationally confident and assured that there is a rightness about the expectation.\nAnd I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 11:9-13 Praying tentatively not quite believing but doubting and lacking such relational confidence has a subtext. Let us for a moment unpack what such doubt says: ‚ÄúI do not really believe that you can do this‚Äù; ‚ÄúI do not believe you are such a good Father‚Äù; ‚ÄúI do not believe you care sufficiently about me or the one I pray for to answer my prayer‚Äù; ‚ÄúI do not believe you\u0026rsquo;re even listening‚Äù. Repudiate such doubt! It has no place among the beloved‚∏∫for that is who we are, and that should remain foremost in our minds as we pray, quite how much we are loved.\nJesus demonstrated infinite love when he chose to die on the cross to rescue all of humankind. The mathematician in me cannot help but notice that an eight-billionth slice of infinite love is infinite love.\nPray confidently, Amy, believing not doubting, and bless your Heavenly Father with the impudence of your intercession! üôè\n","date":"2023-05-24T06:15:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/impudent-intercession/tyler-nix-8youKEwX0vY-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_2426339_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/impudent-intercession/","title":"Impudent intercession"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the desire of the sower?\nAnd when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, [Jesus] said in a parable, ‚ÄúA sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it. And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold.‚Äù As he said these things, he called out, ‚ÄúHe who has ears to hear, let him hear.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 8:4-8 In all three synoptic gospels where Jesus refers to the prophecy from Isaiah 6:9-10 it is in the context of the parable of the sower (Matthew 13:1-23, Mark 4:1-20, Luke 8:4-15). Let\u0026rsquo;s ponder that.\nAnd when his disciples asked him what this parable meant, he said, ‚ÄúTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that ‚Äòseeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.‚Äô\n‚Äï Luke 8:9-10 This prophecy is just so uncomfortable, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Let\u0026rsquo;s just see if we can relate it to what we know of the goodness and kindness and steadfast love and faithfulness of our heavenly father by asking, what is the desire of the sower?\nHaven\u0026rsquo;t you ever wondered this: the sower was really quite a bad farmer, wasn\u0026rsquo;t he? Why was he so profligate in his sowing? What a waste to sow that precious seed in all the wrong places! But was it really wasteful? Or is this nothing less than God\u0026rsquo;s super-abundant generosity and grace towards unrepentant sinners?\nAnd consider Jesus\u0026rsquo; urgent cry, his most impassioned invitation: ‚ÄúHe who has ears to hear, let him hear.‚Äù\nSo, what is the desire of the sower? And why is the message of salvation wrapped up in parables, shrouded in mystery? Jeremiah has a clue for us.\nYou will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you, declares the LORD \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Jeremiah 29:13-14a Jesus underlines exactly this in the Sermon on the Mount.\nAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.\n‚Äï Matthew 7:7-8 The one who seeks, and seeks with all their heart, that one will find. The gospel is not a spectator sport. But for those who cry out for mercy and seek with all their heart, to these is the Kingdom revealed. In his great wisdom and mercy and kindness, so has the Lord made it.\nTrust the Lord, Amy, in his plans and purposes to rescue and redeem all of humankind, he knows what he is doing and it is very good! üôè\n","date":"2023-05-17T06:15:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-desire-of-the-sower/melissa-askew-y4xZxzN754M-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_2140019_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-desire-of-the-sower/","title":"The desire of the sower"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the elephant in the room of Isaiah 6?\nIsaiah\u0026rsquo;s vision of the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, is a glimpse into heaven itself and convicts him deeply of his own sinfulness. We should be similarly convicted. But immediately after his guilt is taken away and his sin atoned for, we find this.\nAnd I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‚ÄúWhom shall I send, and who will go for us?‚Äù Then I said, ‚ÄúHere I am! Send me.‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúGo, and say to this people:\n‚Äú‚ÄòKeep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.‚Äô Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 6:8-10 What are we to make of this?\nJesus said a similar thing to his disciples.\nThen the disciples came and said to him, ‚ÄúWhy do you speak to them in parables?‚Äù And he answered them, ‚ÄúTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Matthew 13:10-14a We must understand this in the context of the verbs that the Lord uses when commanding Isaiah: make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes. This is not a passive observation of failure to understand. It is the actual cause. To them it has not been given. The Lord himself confounds the understanding of the lost, lest they turn and be saved.\nWhat are we to make of it? And how is it remotely fair?\nFirstly, we must not brush this aside merely because it offends our sensibilities. May we never presume so to stand in judgment on the revealed word of God. He is sovereign, not us. So we must grapple, and we must grapple in the context of what we know to be true.\nWhat then do we know to be true? Behold God\u0026rsquo;s own description of himself, his response to Moses\u0026rsquo; request, please show me now your ways, that I may know you.\nThe LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 34:6-7 We had no right to expect that the infinitely powerful creator God of the universe, glorious in splendour and terrifying in holiness, would be quite so good and kind. But we must not overlook that the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God (Exodus 34:14). Nor must we overlook the judgment to the third and fourth generation, nor the steadfast love to the thousandth generation, nor the orders of magnitude difference between these.\nUltimately our response will be the same as Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s.\nThen I said, ‚ÄúHow long, O Lord?‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 6:11 How long, O Lord? We have grappled with this before. But here we must notice something else, even after the land has become a desolate waste, and after the burning again of the tenth that remains‚∏∫terebinth or oak, whose stump remains when it is felled: the holy seed is its stump (Isaiah 6:13)‚∏∫hope remains!

In fact it was nothing of the sort.\nAbove him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said:\n‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!‚Äù\nAnd the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.\n‚Äï Isaiah 6:2-4 So mighty was the voice of that single seraph that it shook the very foundations of the temple. This was nothing commonplace at all.\nIsaiah\u0026rsquo;s response is revealing. We would do well to pay attention to it.\nAnd I said: ‚ÄúWoe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 6:5 How interesting. Of all the things about which Isaiah could have been convicted, of all his failures and shortcomings exposed before the Lord of hosts, he knew his doom was sealed by his unclean lips, by the words he had spoken‚∏∫and the words of the people amongst whom he lived, their words also condemned him. His own sin was not excused by the sin of those around him. Rather their sin compounded his own.\nOur words matter to an extent that may be difficult to grasp. They carry great power‚∏∫power to heal or power to destroy. Remember that each one of us is made in the image of the living God, the living God who, infinite in power and awesome in splendour and majesty, simply spoke the universe into existence. Words matter. Jesus said as much.\n‚ÄúFor out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 12:34-37 How words matter‚∏∫and Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s words condemned him. In the presence of the holy, holy, holy Lord of hosts, he knew he was a man of unclean lips, and he was undone. He so needed what came next.\nThen one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: ‚ÄúBehold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 6:6-7 How powerful are the words we speak, for good or for evil. And how we ourselves need to be saved from our own shortcomings in this area.\nBut what does it say? ‚ÄúThe word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart‚Äù (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.\n‚Äï Romans 10:8-10 Praise our wonderful Saviour who can rescue from words spoken foolishly or even with malice. We must repent, receive forgiveness, and know that just like Isaiah, our guilt is taken away and our sin atoned for.

Prayers of compassion, of kindness, of longing, of desperation, of joyful surrender. Prayers for deliverance for God\u0026rsquo;s most faithful servants. Prayers for healing. Prayers offered with tears, and prayers offered from broken hearts. Where do all these prayers go?\nThe apostle John gives us a peek into the very throne room of heaven. Look what we find there.\nAnd between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.\n‚Äï Revelation 5:6-8 Here in these golden bowls of incense are the prayers of the saints. Our prayers. That\u0026rsquo;s right, those prayers we pray which please the Lord are kept in golden bowls in the throne room of heaven, held by the twenty-four elders. And then what?\nWhen the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.\n‚Äï Revelation 8:1-4 These prayers are a fragrant offering to the Lord on the golden altar before his very throne!

And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.‚Äù Peter said to him, ‚ÄúLord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.‚Äù Jesus said, ‚ÄúI tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 22:31-34 Even in such a familiar passage, here is something to notice afresh. Jesus refers to Peter by his pre-Christian name, Simon. Why is that? Remember that he had previously given him a new name.\n‚ÄúAnd I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 16:18 So why does Jesus momentarily call him Simon here and then almost immediately Peter again? How interesting. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I think about this. The crux is not that he initially calls him Simon, but that he then calls him Peter, and this is what Jesus wants to emphasize. Even as he is foretelling his denial, Jesus is affirming him as Peter, his chosen one, Cephas the rock. Even in his denial he is still Peter. He is still Jesus\u0026rsquo; chosen one!\nOnly shortly afterwards it happened just as Jesus had said.\nAnd when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, ‚ÄúThis man also was with him.‚Äù But he denied it, saying, ‚ÄúWoman, I do not know him.‚Äù And a little later someone else saw him and said, ‚ÄúYou also are one of them.‚Äù But Peter said, ‚ÄúMan, I am not.‚Äù And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, ‚ÄúCertainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.‚Äù But Peter said, ‚ÄúMan, I do not know what you are talking about.‚Äù And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.\n‚Äï Luke 22:55-60 And then what?\nAnd the Lord turned and looked at Peter.\n‚Äï v61a What would have been in that look from Jesus? Disappointment surely, and sadness‚∏∫sadness beyond imagining‚∏∫but also love, such love. Steadfast love. Irrefutable love. The love that would send Jesus to the cross, in obedience to his Father, love even unto death. Love for Peter.\nAnd Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, ‚ÄúBefore the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.‚Äù And he went out and wept bitterly.\n‚Äï v61b-62 Peter realised he had denied the Lord who loved him, who had affirmed him, and who loved him still. And in his shame and wretchedness and humiliation he wept bitterly. At the time of crisis, when Jesus was going to his death, he, Peter, had been found not to be worthy. He was nothing but a shameful failure. How he wept over that failure, his failure to love Jesus as he loved him.\nSo where does this leave us, as we approach Good Friday? Where does it leave me? What of my own denial? Anxiety that denies Jesus as Saviour. Vestigial sin that seeks to deny him as Lord. Here\u0026rsquo;s where: Jesus turns and looks at me, and he loves me. In love he stretched out his arms on that cross and died for me, and for you, Amy. I know I am not worthy of this love, but it makes no difference to Jesus.

Why do I think this matters?\nAll Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.\n‚Äï 2 Timothy 3:16-17 The ‚Äúman of God‚Äù is a common Old Testament expression, which can refer to male or female, and indeed the NIV translates this as servant of God. It simply means us, you or me.\nBut, all Scripture? Including Leviticus? For us?! How could that possibly be relevant for Christians living in a post-resurrection world? Let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nFor I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy.\n‚Äï Leviticus 11:44 The apostle Peter endorses its relevance.\nAs obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, ‚ÄúYou shall be holy, for I am holy.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Peter 1:14-16 My study Bible summarises it like this: the book of Leviticus is concerned with what it means to be the holy people of a holy God. And what could be more relevant for us than that?\nWe gain insight from Leviticus into things we might otherwise overlook. What can we learn from the myriad of seemingly picky little laws that we would instinctively brush aside and not think about? Such things were clearly of great importance to the Lord. Ought we not at least to ponder why that was? These are not unrelated to those matters upon which Jesus expounded in the Sermon on the Mount, and Paul also has long lists over which we must take great care. The Lord is apparently greatly concerned about things we may be inclined to brush aside as ‚Äúdetails‚Äù.\nFurthermore, to understand the sacrificial system of the Old Testament we must study Leviticus, and by this we can start to understand Jesus\u0026rsquo; own sacrifice on the cross. Why did it have to be quite so bloody? And why did he have to die such a death? Leviticus teaches us such.\nFor the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.\n‚Äï Leviticus 17:11 There is also much we can learn of God\u0026rsquo;s own heart from reading Leviticus, such that as we grow in this knowledge we can more fully honour him. For example,\n‚ÄúWhen you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, neither shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. And you shall not strip your vineyard bare, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the LORD your God.\n‚Äï Leviticus 19:9-10 What compassion there is to be found here, what concern for the poor and for the alien. The God who gave this commandment is our God, who does not change. It turns out that the book of Leviticus is a veritable treasure trove!\nAs we look into it, unpacking these treasures, let us not forget the headline.\nBe holy, Amy, because he is holy! üôè\n","date":"2023-03-29T06:00:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/be-holy-for-i-am-holy/linda-christiansen-cybTg_gYWkw-unsplash_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_2051731_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/be-holy-for-i-am-holy/","title":"Be holy, for I am holy"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nKnowing that our God is the God of all comfort and healing, how can we minister this to the brokenhearted?\nIt is hard to write about such things when grief and loss are present and quite so raw. But it is precisely at such a time that we must engage with the Lord, and seek to understand, if he is the God of all comfort and healing, which he is, how is that outworked at such a time?\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 At such times we are supposed to be able to comfort those in need with the comfort we ourselves have received from God. But how often do we seem to be of no use in this, not knowing even what to say or do? In the weeping face of heartbreak, how can we in fact be of any comfort at all?\nI have recently been gaining some experience in this, as I am continuing to care for a young friend, a believer in Christ, in the midst of his own trauma, which is ongoing, heartbreaking, and bewildering. In the face of this overwhelming need, the Lord has given me such clarity of understanding of what my friend needs from me, and it is not advice nor explanation nor anything else that I have to say. It is simply Jesus.\nIt does not matter that I do not know what to say or do. Jesus does. So we cry out to him together for mercy. And he responds, with grace and kindness, impossibly and lavishly. The peace that has come surpasses understanding. The need is ongoing, but so is the grace, and so is the rescue.\nOur own comfort is in Jesus and it is Jesus, and so this is what we must minister to others.\nSo what does it look like, to minister Jesus to the brokenhearted? It looks like gentleness, and kindness, and listening, and prayer, and probably a hug, but most especially time‚∏∫more time than 21st Century western civilization would think is a reasonable investment for a single individual. Not much speaking though. This may come later, but is not I think where we are called to start. And above all else, absolute confidence in the one who is mighty to save, whose name is Helper, Comforter, Healer, Lord, whose name is Jesus.

At those times we critically need the Lord\u0026rsquo;s grace and kindness and healing and restoration‚∏∫which he is truly so ready to provide. Instead for now I mean to address those times when things are tending to get on top of us in a smaller way, when nevertheless so much of what we have to do is a trial, when everything seems unreasonably harder than it ought, when life itself has become really quite wearying.\nJesus spoke into this.\nCome to me, all who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 11:28-30 These words are so very familiar, and yet at the same time counter-intuitive. Why is it that our rest is found in other work, in taking his yoke upon us? Couldn\u0026rsquo;t we just, well, rest?!\nBut if by rest we mean doing nothing in particular, that is not in itself refreshing.\nHere is a major source of weariness: those many things in life that we are tempted to approach with the mindset that we can influence, that we know what to do, that we can engineer our desired outcome, for which we have our own agenda. Frustratingly though, such things are so often beyond us. Such thinking is utterly wearying and we must give it over to Jesus.\nInstead, what is Jesus\u0026rsquo; work for us? To live with humility, surrendered to the Father\u0026rsquo;s will, to his plans and purposes, pursuing love and holiness, caring for the outcast and the brokenhearted, bringing gentleness and kindness and light and grace and hope.

He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.\n‚Äï Genesis 9:20-21 And besides being the one who in hope against all hope believed and so became the father of many nations, Abraham was previously a coward and a liar (Genesis 12:10-20) and a man who gave up waiting on the Lord (Genesis 16).\nMoses too was a coward.\nThen the LORD said to him, ‚ÄúWho has made man\u0026rsquo;s mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD? Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.‚Äù But [Moses] said, ‚ÄúOh, my Lord, please send someone else.‚Äù\n‚Äï Exodus 4:11-13 And some time later, even having witnessed the Lord\u0026rsquo;s miraculous deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, Moses\u0026rsquo; lack of faith caused him to make a heinous mistake at Meribah which was most severely punished by God.\nAnd the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, ‚ÄúBecause you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.‚Äù\n‚Äï Numbers 20:12 Moses furthermore failed to take responsibility for this failure, and his later account to the Israelites was simply untrue.\nBut the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me.\n‚Äï Deuteronomy 3:26 To complete our quartet of heroes we have David, that man after God\u0026rsquo;s own heart, that adulterer and murderer (2 Samuel 11).\nWhat instead should we notice about these giants of the faith?

We have been praying about both, and this got me thinking about The Flood, that is, Noah\u0026rsquo;s flood, the introduction to which is simply terrifying.\nThe LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the LORD said, ‚ÄúI will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 6:5-7 The Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. How he must have wept over that, heartbrokenly. And in more recent times? As we look around at what is going on in this broken world, perhaps we can gain some small insight into how that must have felt. This was not as he had created it.\nAnd God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good.\n‚Äï Genesis 1:31 Something had gone terribly wrong, and the Lord\u0026rsquo;s first instinct in wrath and holiness was to eliminate the evil completely and comprehensively‚∏∫simply terrifying.\nBut Noah found favour in the eyes of the LORD.\n‚Äï Genesis 6:8 How could this be? Simply as we are told.\nNoah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation.\n‚Äï Genesis 6:9 Noah was a righteous man, and this was enough for the Lord to find another way to deal with the evil of humankind. And so what was the consequence of Noah\u0026rsquo;s holy and blameless life? God did indeed wipe out from the earth all of humankind, birds, animals, creeping things, except for Noah and his family and the species-representatives which were saved in the ark.\nSo here is the difference that was made by Noah\u0026rsquo;s holy and blameless life. Life on earth was not blotted out, and we ourselves are here today, only because Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation.\nThink on that for a while.

I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.\n‚Äï Philippians 4:11b-12 Paul faced so much hardship in his ministry‚∏∫see 2 Corinthians 11:24-28 for the details, it\u0026rsquo;s quite a list!

For it is good to sing praises to our God; for he is beautiful, and a song of praise is fitting.\n‚Äï Psalm 147:1 To be sure, I am quoting from the ESV alternative translation for that phrase, ‚Äúfor he is beautiful‚Äù. The mainline translation is ‚Äúfor it is pleasant‚Äù, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to me to be such a compelling reason.\nIt is worth looking into how Bible translation is done, what is the nature of the original language, and how it is that the translators came to the interpretations that are written.\nTypes of textual footnotes ‚Äî (1) Footnotes of this kind provide alternative translations for specific words or phrases when there is a strong possibility that such words or phrases could be translated in another way. \u0026hellip; In such cases, the translation deemed to have the stronger support is in the text while other possible renderings are given in the note. (2) \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï ESV Bible Explanation of Features Hebrew pronouns are troublesome! The word translated ‚Äúhe‚Äù is the masculine third person pronoun, but this could also mean ‚Äúit‚Äù, referring to the act of singing praises, itself a masculine noun. No wonder Bible translations differ.\nHow then do we decide on the right translation, the one that honours the Lord and is faithful to what he is saying? And why is it that the ESV translators settled on the mainline of ‚Äúfor it is pleasant‚Äù, relegating to a footnote ‚Äúfor he is beautiful‚Äù? And furthermore, how is it that I have the cheek to call them out about that as a mistake?!\nI considered two factors.\nFirstly, what are the other occurrences of the word translated here as pleasant or beautiful, the Hebrew n√¢‚Äõ√Æym?\nThis word is used 14 times in the Old Testament, and I have to admit, mostly to describe a pleasant experience (‚ÄúThe lines have fallen for me in pleasant places‚Äù ‚Äî Psalm 16:6; ‚ÄúBehold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!‚Å†‚Äù ‚Äî Psalm 133:1). Mostly.\nBut here I deem the second factor to carry more weight, which is, what does the rest of this psalm say? Context is important.\nWhat would we expect in each case? A psalm which starts off with how pleasant it is to praise the Lord could be expected to continue with and expand upon the praise experience. That\u0026rsquo;s not what happens here.\nInstead, our psalm comprises an exposition of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s character, of his nature, of his deeds. It is entirely about the Lord, the beautiful one. This is why we praise him!\nThe LORD builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of Israel.\nHe heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.\nHe determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names.\nGreat is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure.\nThe LORD lifts up the humble; he casts the wicked to the ground.\n‚Äï Psalm 147:2-6 And so it continues. And it is just like this in Psalm 135, where the same Hebrew word is used. He is beautiful (v3).\nWhile I am grateful to those learned and proficient Bible translators who have made available for us the Bible in language we can understand, I am more grateful to the Lord for how he speaks to my heart through his eternal word.\nPraise the Lord, Amy, for he is beautiful! üôè\n","date":"2023-01-25T06:25:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/praise-the-lord/oscar-ivan-esquivel-arteaga-nY1sYUoJXYE-unsplash_hu53fd3444e3758ab06ec2e53a3fd62a24_2394596_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/praise-the-lord/","title":"Praise the Lord!"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the most unanswered question in the Bible?\nHow long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever?\nHow long will you hide your face from me?\nHow long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day?\nHow long shall my enemy be exalted over me?\n‚Äï Psalm 13:1-2 How long, O Lord?\nWhy doesn\u0026rsquo;t the Lord answer? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t he know how hard it is to wait on him? Why won\u0026rsquo;t he at least tell us how long? Imagine how much more straightforward it would be if he did. ‚ÄúHang in there, Amy, for eighteen months. And for you, Simon, six years.‚Äù\nWhy does he not answer?\nActually, this is not all that hard to understand. Paul points us at two reasons in his letter to the Ephesians.\n\u0026hellip; he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.\nFor this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints, I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:4, 15-18 Having the eyes of our hearts enlightened that we may know what is the hope to which he has called us‚∏∫the first reason is our faith, which requires us to use the eyes of our hearts rather than the eyes of our faces. Waiting is faith building, oh how it is that! Waiting confidently on the Lord, not doubting‚∏∫it changes us. It grows our faith. Hear two questions from the Lord in the waiting time: ‚ÄúDo you trust me, Amy?‚Äù and the second, harder one: ‚ÄúHow much do you trust me?‚Äù\nTrust is what David clings to in our psalm. And knowing how long would require less trust.\nThe second reason is our holiness. We were chosen in Christ before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. Our sanctification, our steadily increasing holiness, is a work of the Holy Spirit, but it is also our own most earnest hard work. What better work is there to do in the waiting time, that at the time of fulfilment we may be found to be holy and blameless in his sight?\nHabbakuk also cries out with the same question.\nO LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear?\n‚Äï Habakkuk 1:2 In his particular case, the Lord answers, and praise him for that answer in which we also can rejoice.\n‚ÄúLook among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told.‚Äù\n‚Äï Habakkuk 1:5 And so it is for us. We would not believe if told the work the Lord is doing in our own waiting time. It is a work of faith, of holiness, and of fulfilment of promises.\nPraise the Lord, wonder and be astounded, Amy, for he is doing a work in our lives which we would not believe if told! üôè\n","date":"2023-01-18T07:30:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/how-long-o-lord/zoltan-tasi-CLJeQCr2F_A-unsplash_hu757e250a816347d7284fe3c0e8160530_4254706_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/how-long-o-lord/","title":"How long, O Lord?"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWho is your least favourite Bible character?\nMany of the kings of Israel were thoroughly wicked, and Jezebel was an absolute shocker, evil beyond imagining, but for me there is one who stands out, a truly vile and revolting little man: Jacob.\nJacob was a man without integrity. Even his name means ‚Äúhe cheats‚Äù. He manipulated his starving brother Esau to give up the birthright to him. He tricked his aging, blind father to give him the blessing that was due to Esau, lying brazenly even as he was receiving it. His household was defined by immorality and unfaithfulness, as he fathered children through each and every one of Leah, Rachel, and the two servant girls Bilhah and Zilpah. He stole Laban\u0026rsquo;s livestock through a dirty little scheme of corrupting their breeding process, after which he ran away. And years later, when Esau had graciously forgiven him and was offering an emotional reconciliation (revealing the noble heart his brother lacked) Jacob still continued with his tricks and lies. What a despicable little man he was (Genesis 25-33).\nAfter all this what then happened?\nGod appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. And God said to him, ‚ÄúYour name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.‚Äù So he called his name Israel. And God said to him, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body. The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 35:9-12 Isn\u0026rsquo;t this simply astonishing?

Is the Lord such a terrible judge of character that he made a rather poor choice here? By no means!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the key to understanding this.\nBut God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, ‚ÄúLet the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.‚Äù\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 1:27-31 We would do well to remember this.

It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.\n‚Äï Lamentations 3:21-26 These few verses are a shaft of light in the book of Lamentations which otherwise makes for a sobering read. The backdrop is the destruction of Jerusalem after an eighteen month siege by Nebuchadnezzar, and the exile of Judah to Babylon. It was the grimmest of times. The city was plundered and its inhabitants taken into captivity. Women were raped; priests, prophets and officials executed. There was famine so severe that mothers were eating their own children.\nWorst of all, this was the Lord\u0026rsquo;s judgment on his own people, his chosen ones, for their ongoing waywardness and apostasy.\nJudah has gone into exile because of affliction and hard servitude; \u0026hellip; because the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions;\nJerusalem sinned grievously; therefore she became filthy;\nLook and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which was brought upon me, which the LORD inflicted on the day of his fierce anger.\n‚Äï Lamentations 1:3, 5, 8, 12 This was the just and holy judgment of our God whose name is Jealous, a consuming fire.\nWe should tremble as we read, and then repent and expel every last sin from our own lives and purge every wrong thought and every crooked motive from our own hearts and minds.

Let\u0026rsquo;s notice afresh just three of these oddities, and see if we can understand in them something of the mystery of God\u0026rsquo;s ways, remembering that such Bible stories were not written to satisfy our curiosity nor merely for our edification. Rather they were written to bring us into relationship with our Heavenly Father and to grow us in that relationship. So, who they were, their strange gifts, and the nature of that star.\nNow after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, ‚ÄúWhere is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.‚Äù\nAfter listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.\n‚Äï Matthew 2:1-2, 9-12 Other than the east we don\u0026rsquo;t know where they came from‚∏∫perhaps Babylon or maybe somewhere further afield‚∏∫but we do know they weren\u0026rsquo;t Jews. They were pagans from a faraway land, nevertheless coming to worship the Son of God. Jesus was so much more than the king of the Jews. He came to save all of humankind.\nNow, those strange gifts: gold for kingship, frankincense for deity, and myrrh for death. Can you imagine the conversation when they were packing? ‚ÄúHey Melchior, why are you taking myrrh? That\u0026rsquo;s for embalming dead bodies. It\u0026rsquo;s such a weird gift for a baby!‚Äù Surely he didn\u0026rsquo;t even know why myrrh was the right gift.\nAnd that ‚Äústar‚Äù which the magi first saw when it rose, which then seems to have disappeared on them such that they had to enter Jerusalem and ask around, where was the one they had come to worship? The result of which was, rather than quietly arriving at their precise destination, the whole of Jerusalem got to know what was happening. How interesting! As soon as that had happened, the star reappeared and guided them right to the house where Jesus was. Clearly no kind of star or celestial object then, but surely rather some angelic guide.\nNow consider, how could it all have happened like this? The Lord\u0026rsquo;s ways are so deeply mysterious and here rather opaque. He is however so fully able to achieve his plans and purposes, outworking them even through fallible individuals lacking understanding, but nevertheless bringing glory to his name.\nAnd going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him.\n‚Äï Matthew 2:11 Thank the Lord, Amy, for his wisdom, for the mystery of his ways, and for the greatest gift which is Christ the Lord, and worship him! üôè\n","date":"2022-12-28T08:30:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-visit-of-the-magi/inbal-malca-NhlKx6Uvm3E-unsplash_hud6bbc92ce2f124794cb736139a9f423b_327890_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-visit-of-the-magi/","title":"The visit of the magi"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWelcome back‚∏∫and how lovely it was to see you face to face again after all this time! May the Lord grant you real rest over these next few weeks, and may you be revitalised and restored in his presence. ‚ù§Ô∏è\nNow, have you ever been surprised to notice something afresh in a very familiar Bible story?\nAnd isn\u0026rsquo;t the Bible truly amazing? I am continually finding such freshness, profound truths apparently plainly stated yet previously unnoticed or simply rediscovered. I came across one such only this week, in the oh-so-familiar Nativity story.\nWhen his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ‚ÄúJoseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.‚Äù All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:\n‚ÄúBehold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel‚Äù\n(which means, God with us).\n‚Äï Matthew 1:18-23 Before we get into what I noticed, let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to be amazed once again at the whole Christmas story. I once read that of the incarnation and the resurrection, the incarnation is the greater miracle, and I am inclined to agree‚∏∫God contracted to a span, incomprehensibly made man! Praise our Lord and Saviour!\nNow, what is it that I noticed afresh in this passage? Simply this: Joseph son of David.\nParentage is important in the Bible. Notice throughout that characters are introduced as so-and-so son of so-and-so. Matthew tells that Joseph\u0026rsquo;s father was Jacob, so why did the angel address him as Joseph son of David, his ancestor of a thousand years? Here\u0026rsquo;s what I take from that.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s rescue mission in Christ was planned from the very beginning, in his glorious promise of defeat of Satan and rescue by Christ, the Son of God, and miraculously also a descendant of the first man and the first woman.\nThe LORD God said to the serpent \u0026hellip;\n‚ÄúI will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 3:14a, 15 By addressing Joseph as son of David the angel is reminding both him and us of just how long in the making has been God\u0026rsquo;s plan of rescue and redemption, and of the prophecies that foretold of the Messiah coming from David\u0026rsquo;s line. How reassuring for Joseph to know that what was happening was part of a long established plan, intricately woven from strands of love.\nAnd it is not entirely dissimilar for us.\nFor you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother\u0026rsquo;s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.\n‚Äï Psalm 139:13-16 Remember this, Amy, that you are loved with an ancient love, and have been from the beginning! üôè\n","date":"2022-12-21T06:30:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/joseph-son-of-david/chris-curry-KsSxzBnozMY-unsplash_hu01b44f4f9d932758ec7698e09f822e5b_3199385_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/joseph-son-of-david/","title":"Joseph son of David"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nAt the time of crisis, how can we be completely confident in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s protection and provision?\nAs I write this, I am facing a situation at work which will surely result in me losing my job, as a direct result of living with integrity and honouring the Lord. And yet, I have such a peace about it. The Lord\u0026rsquo;s fingerprints are all over it. I will leave and everything will be fine‚∏∫more than fine in fact. This seems to me to be a key step in the Lord outworking his Kingdom plans and purposes in my life. Praise him!\nAnd so I write this to you out of my own acute and current experience, aware and indeed hoping and praying that you do not find yourself in a similar place anytime soon! Nevertheless, it is all I have for you this week as my gift of love. May it bless your own heart regardless. ‚ù§Ô∏è\nConsider Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They lived with integrity, honouring the Lord, and as a result were told, worship Nebuchadnezzar\u0026rsquo;s golden image or be immediately cast into the fiery furnace. What was their response?\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, ‚ÄúO Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.‚Äù\n‚Äï Daniel 3:16-18 How could they be so confident before the most powerful man in the land, who held their very lives in his hands. Didn\u0026rsquo;t he? Even recognising that they may not survive the flames, they were resolute and unassailable. To understand this we have to go back a bit in the story.\nBut Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king\u0026rsquo;s food, or with the wine that he drank.\nThen Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah [aka Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego], ‚ÄúTest your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king\u0026rsquo;s food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see.‚Äù\nSo the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.\n‚Äï Daniel 1:8a, 11-13, 16 These four boys, strangers in a strange land, were completely sold out for the Lord, living their lives in full obedience, serving and honouring him. Living on vegetables and water was just one aspect of that. Not tasty! And the Lord blessed and prospered them in their obedience.\nYou know the rest. Jesus himself stood alongside the three boys in the flames. They emerged completely unharmed, not even a little singed. And as a result, Nebuchadnezzar worshipped the Lord.\nSo here is the key. Live such a life of integrity, honouring the Lord, giving up pleasures and privileges to serve him better, just as in fact you are doing, Amy, in the village‚∏∫well done, you good and faithful servant! And at the time of crisis, be absolutely confident that not only will the Lord himself stand alongside you, honouring you, but he will use it to outwork his Kingdom plans and purposes.

So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, ‚ÄúThey have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 20:1-2 Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them.\n‚Äï John 21:20 John never refers to himself by name, only ever ‚Äúthe disciple whom Jesus loved‚Äù. Why would this be?\nFirstly I want to reject the idea that Jesus loved John more than the others. That makes no sense to me, for it would mean he loved the others less, and I find that to be ridiculous. He loved without limit each and every person he encountered, just as he loves each and every one of us. There are no favourites and no less-thans.\nNow Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.\n‚ÄúSee how he loved him!‚Äù\n‚Äï John 11:5, 36 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\n‚Äï John 3:16 By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us.\n‚Äï 1 John 3:16 The other gospel writers make no use of this phrase‚∏∫it is purely how John describes himself. This is surely the clue, that John is acutely aware of quite how loved by Jesus he is. It is not the love that is greater, but his awareness of that love. And that changes everything.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a striking consequence of that level of awareness. John\u0026rsquo;s gospel has more to say about love than all three of the other gospels combined. And his first letter is all and entirely about love.\nWe love because he first loved us.\n‚Äï 1 John 4:19 How John understood this, and how it transformed his writing and his ministry!\nWhat then is our response when we become aware of the boundless nature of this unfathomable love?\nA new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 13:34-35 In whatever situation we find ourselves and whatever the challenge we face, may we hear the kindly voice of the apostle John urging us, ‚ÄúLittle children, remember to love‚Äù.\nSo it is simply John\u0026rsquo;s awareness of Jesus\u0026rsquo; great love for him that enables him to describe himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved‚∏∫an observation which has a truly wonderful corollary: each one of us can own such a description for ourselves!\nAs you continue your ministry in the village, Amy, know that you are the teacher whom Jesus loves, and be transformed by your awareness of that love! üôè\n","date":"2022-12-07T06:24:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-disciple-whom-jesus-loved/harry-quan-G1iYCeCW2EI-unsplash_hu9ef212b95a065b2f82f68b51afe27c4f_909219_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-disciple-whom-jesus-loved/","title":"The disciple whom Jesus loved"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhy is there so much confusion today around what it means to be led by the Spirit?\nI wrote recently about being led by the Spirit in the context of the grace-filled life, focusing on loving the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, and loving one another, unconditionally and without exception, in joyful surrender. Surrender is in fact the key word here and there is a bit more that needs to be said.\nIt is remarkably easy to tell when someone is confused about what it means to be led by the Spirit, because you will hear them use words like ‚Äúdiscern‚Äù.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider the context in which Paul uses this expression.\nFor if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons [and daughters] of God.\n‚Äï Romans 8:13-14 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.\n‚Äï Galatians 5:16-18 Notice that being led by the Spirit is about putting to death the deeds of the body and not gratifying the desires of the flesh. This has nothing to do with understanding or insight! It is all about the power of the sanctified will.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t do better than to quote Jim Packer on this.\nTwice Paul speaks of being ‚Äúled‚Äù by the Spirit (Romans 8:14; Galatians 5:18). Both times the reference is to resisting one\u0026rsquo;s own sinful impulses as the flip side of one\u0026rsquo;s practice of righteousness. Leads is rightly taken to mean ‚Äúguides‚Äù, but the guidance in view here is not a revealing to the mind of divine directives hitherto unknown; it is, rather, an impelling of our wills to pursue and practice and hold fast that sanctity whose terms we know already. Thus to be led and guided, says Paul, is the mark of a Christian.\n‚Äï J.I. Packer, Keep in Step with the Spirit, Chapter 3 An impelling of our wills to pursue and practice and hold fast that sanctity whose terms we know already. Now recall Packer\u0026rsquo;s premise from Chapter 1 of the very same book. The primary work of the Holy Spirit is to mediate the presence of Jesus in our lives.\nThe presence of Jesus in our lives is glorious, victorious, powerful, sanctifying. It enables us to surrender our will to what is right and true and pleasing to the Lord, and to do it, for his glory and for our own eternal blessing.

He rescued him and restored him and gave him something to do (1 Kings 19:15-18). Let me paraphrase it like this.\n‚ÄúIt\u0026rsquo;s ok, Elijah, I\u0026rsquo;ve got this. And by the way, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. I have seven thousand others. And you are still useful to me.

It defeated Elijah, that mighty prophet of God, who ran for his life and hid in a cave, where he was rebuked by the Lord (albeit with great tenderness).\nThere he came to a cave and lodged in it.

You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar. You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways.

I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\nMy frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.\n‚Äï Psalm 139:1-4, 13-14a, 15-16 That I am known by my loving Heavenly Father quite so comprehensively and quite so intimately is truly wonderful. For one thing it completely dispels fear. All is fully known. The Lord is acquainted with all my ways. There is nothing hidden that could suddenly be revealed and remove his love for me, or for you. God already knows it all. He knows the very worst and he loves. He already knew and still he chose to love.\nBut God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:8 There\u0026rsquo;s only one thing left to say. Consider the most well known passage on love in the Bible, the passage that is read at weddings and which makes our souls sing: 1 Corinthians 13. Have you noticed Paul\u0026rsquo;s penultimate point there?\nNow I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 13:12b Knowing and loving go together and they grow together.

Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God.\n‚Äï Exodus 2:23 Is this really what God had intended? Had it somehow all gone horribly wrong? Not really.\nAnd God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. God saw the people of Israel‚∏∫and God knew.\n‚Äï Exodus 2:24-25 God knew.

This is fraught with danger! Satan is the father of lies and the great deceiver, and by stroking our egos and flattering our vanity he can manipulate our feelings even and perhaps especially in this realm. How can we escape this?\nFor the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.\nNow the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.\n‚Äï Galatians 5:17, 19-23 That first list is truly shocking, and we might be tempted to think is far from where we live our lives, but consider idolatry for one‚∏∫in regard to career, reputation, and respectability, how evident is this in every church! Now, notice that eight out of these fifteen works of the flesh comprise dysfunctional relationship and unlove.

There\u0026rsquo;s more than love in the second list, of course, but that\u0026rsquo;s surely the headline.

Show me the one who does not find themselves on the wrong side of particular verses in the Bible, and does not have to cast themselves upon God\u0026rsquo;s mercy even to live their life. Does such a one exist?\nJesus himself faced a law versus grace issue in relation to the Fourth Commandment, and on one occasion when confronted by the Pharisees, he related the story of David apparently breaking the law by eating with his men consecrated bread from the temple, before concluding:\n‚ÄúI tell you, something greater than the temple is here. And if you had known what this means, \u0026lsquo;I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,\u0026rsquo; you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 12:6-8 Does this mean that under grace everything is in fact somewhat grey? By no means!\nEverything rather is lit by a dazzling technicolour explosion of grace and redemption from the Lord, and that particular mercy which triumphs over judgment. This enables some women to pursue a preaching ministry for his glory, some divorced men to remarry by his grace, and others to live their lives in dependence on the riches of his mercy. Praise the Lord!\nKnow that this in no way removes or diminishes our call to live as slaves to righteousness, fully surrendered and walking in obedience with the Lord.

Moses once asked exactly this, and behold:\nThe LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children\u0026rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped.\n‚Äï Exodus 34:5-8 Moses\u0026rsquo; response is the only one possible‚∏∫a heart-response of worship and adoration, a song to the Creator God of the universe, to the one who loves us, who is our rescuer, our rock and our redeemer.\nMy heart is an instrument of love, and this is the melody I can make to the name of the one who loves you and me both with boundless, unfathomable love, to all that he is and all that he has done.\nSing and make melody to the Lord with your heart, Amy, to the one who has rescued us and loves us beyond imagining! üôè\n","date":"2022-10-05T06:24:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/a-melody-made-with-the-heart/nadin-mario-pO4ZI2krY_k-unsplash_hu529edfdeac2025c0e1ef469cb812f7b2_971607_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/a-melody-made-with-the-heart/","title":"A melody made with the heart"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is this life for?\nThis has been stated with exceeding clarity by those who went before us.\nWhat is the chief end of man?\nMan‚Äôs chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.\n‚Äï Westminster Shorter Catechism, 1647 This can refocus and reframe our whole lives, especially that word enjoy. But let me for a moment observe that our glorification of the Lord and our enjoyment of him will be so much the greater in our post resurrection life, so let me ask, what is this life for?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a related question. Is this life more about the journey or the destination?\nTruly I long for the destination, to arrive in the presence of my Lord and Saviour, to finally stand face to face. John describes the meeting as it will be.\nThen I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\n‚Äï Revelation 21:1-2 This is the bride of Christ, his beloved church of which you and I are members, Amy, and in the words of that beautiful song,\nShe will be who he adores, this is what he made her for.\n‚Äï Casting Crowns, Wedding Day But what is this preparation of which John speaks?\nThe preparation is this life. It is the journey. The destination that I must therefore focus on is that of the state of my heart. I desire to arrive well, welcomed into heaven with smiles and joy, not as one escaping through the flames (1 Corinthians 3:15). In advance of that, there is heart-work to be done, so that on that day I will not be ashamed at the smallness of my own heart and its miserly love for my Saviour and for my fellow travellers.\nAnd so this realisation informs every choice I make on the journey. The Holy Spirit continues to do his work of sanctifying grace in my life and I surrender to it joyfully and my heart is transformed. Slowly. Surely. Through each painful moment, I continue to die to self and live for him, all the while longing for that day, and all the while growing in love for my wonderful Saviour and his beloved church.\nBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\n‚Äï Matthew 5:8 Journey well, Amy! üôè\n","date":"2022-09-28T06:25:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-journey/finding-dan-dan-grinwis-O35rT6OytRo-unsplash_hu351eff5db8ab3f37df4be5ae5a855bc3_1229583_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-journey/","title":"The journey"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhy is it that some seem to receive more bounteous blessing from the Lord than others? How is that fair? And how is it congruent with a God of justice?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with fair, and let\u0026rsquo;s be frank. What would be fair would be for each one of us to be cast into the fiery pit. And collectively, we must take responsibility through our wretched ancestors for much of the suffering of humankind, for we share the same rebellious spirit.\n‚ÄúBecause you have \u0026hellip; eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‚ÄòYou shall not eat of it,‚Äô cursed is the ground because of you.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 3:17 But, and this is a wonderful, unmerited, joyous but,\nIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\n‚Äï 1 John 1:9 What a rescue! What a Saviour! Praise him!\nSo, with grateful, praising hearts, in fear and trembling, let us dare to ask again, how is it that God\u0026rsquo;s blessing is quite so unevenly distributed?\nPaul grappled with such a question in relation to the election of the gentiles and God\u0026rsquo;s apparent rejection of the nation of Israel (Romans 9-11). That he takes three chapters over this shows us that such questions are no small matter.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take some of his arguments and apply them to the more general question of uneven blessing.\nWhat shall we say then? Is there injustice on God\u0026rsquo;s part? By no means! For he says to Moses, ‚ÄúI will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.‚Äù\n‚Äï Romans 9:14-15 It is all mercy, and it is all undeserved. And let us not forget that the giver is the Creator God of the Universe.\nHas the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honourable use and another for dishonourable use? What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory.\n‚Äï Romans 9:21-23 Somehow in the unevenness of the blessing, God is making known the riches of his glory. Paul also shows us how to respond in the face of the apparent injustice of it all.\nBrothers, my heart\u0026rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.\n‚Äï Romans 10:1 And observe the extent of his love.\nI have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers.\n‚Äï Romans 9:2-3 Is this then the key to understanding? Even as we cry out to God over the unevenness of the blessing, is this our opportunity to learn how to truly love, and in so doing to glorify God?\nJesus said,\n‚ÄúI was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 25:35-36, 40 May the Lord enlarge our hearts for this broken world as we look around and see places where his blessing seems to be absent. And let us cry out to him for mercy, to the Lord, our Heavenly Father.\nIn case you think we have arrived at a place of only partial understanding, let us observe that Paul himself, the great apostle and teacher, is in just that place after three chapters of his own wrestling.\nOh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!\nFor from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever.

For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.\n‚Äï Romans 6:13-14 We should note that God\u0026rsquo;s call to personal holiness is not to the righteous but to sinners, and we would do well to remember his call to Abraham out of the absolute mess and shame that he found himself in thirteen long years after his shabby act with Hagar. Hear the grace and love in this, right alongside the uncompromising call to holiness. Our Heavenly Father has so much love and such a high expectation for his sons and daughters.\nWhen Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 17:1 Only in Christ can we live like this, but in him, we can!

Simply that all that is within me, the very core of my being, reveals and makes known and honours the character and person of God, and is aligned in love and praise and worship and affirmation that the Lord is great and so worthy of praise.

Too often we think in purely human terms, but there\u0026rsquo;s another dimension here.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s one side of the coin.\nFor it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfil his good purpose.\n‚Äï Philippians 2:13 For we are God‚Äôs handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:10 The Lord has plans and purposes, and he works in and through each one of us to fulfil them.

Church can be the loneliest place, and I was facing the bleak prospect of a Sunday afternoon by myself, at a time when I was particularly downcast.

Suddenly there was a knock on my back door. It was my neighbour, with a slice of apple shortcake she had just made, and a little tub of cream to go with it. How lovely. She had no idea it was my birthday, nor did I tell her. How random again.\nI have learned that these random acts of kindness are not remotely random.

Not every Bible translation has the same paragraph breaks, but in both of my preferred translations‚∏∫the NIV 1984 and the ESV‚∏∫the armour of God is described in just one paragraph, which in the NIV ends with this.\nAnd pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.\n‚Äï Ephesians 6:18 How interesting that Paul would conclude his writing about the armour of God with this. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider how praying in the Spirit could be considered a vital piece of the armour.\nFirstly, what does ‚Äúin the Spirit‚Äù even mean? There seems to be much confusion today about what is the work of the Holy Spirit. Jim Packer wrote a whole book about it, Keep in Step with the Spirit, in which he outlines some of the secondary aspects that seem to occupy most people\u0026rsquo;s attention, including power, revelation, and promptings, before arguing that the primary work of the Holy Spirit is to mediate the presence of Jesus in our lives. And indeed, this matches with what Jesus says of the Spirit in John 14.\nWhat Paul writes in Romans is closely related.\nIn the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.\n‚Äï Romans 8:26 Let\u0026rsquo;s not overthink this. Praying in the Spirit is simply praying in relationship with Jesus. There is no formula, just as there is no formula in human relationship. Mutual commitment and time spent together are required for the relationship to flourish. Jesus is committed! How he is that!! Are we?\nWe must do this on all occasions, and with all kinds of prayers and requests. Let\u0026rsquo;s not get into a rut of formulaic praying. Let\u0026rsquo;s sit with our wonderful Saviour and enjoy intimacy in relationship. In his presence we are protected in the spiritual battle.\nNotice too that Paul\u0026rsquo;s instruction is to pray for all the saints, that is, all Christians. In the spiritual battle we must avoid at all cost turning in on ourselves, as if we are the ones who matter most. By no means!

We won\u0026rsquo;t get this from isolated verses. We get it from extensive reading and studying of the Bible. This is the only way to handle the word of God with integrity.\nThe greatest help I have found in this intimidating task is a book I bought while at university, shortly after becoming a Christian.\nBecause the Bible is God\u0026rsquo;s Word, it has eternal relevance; it speaks to all mankind, in every age and in every culture. Because it is God\u0026rsquo;s Word, we must listen‚∏∫and obey. But because God chose to speak His Word through human words in history, every book in the Bible also has historical particularity; each document is conditioned by the language, time, and culture in which it was originally written (and in some cases also by the oral history it had before it was written down). Interpretation of the Bible is demanded by the ‚Äútension‚Äù that exists between its eternal relevance and its historical particularity.\nA text cannot mean what it never meant. Or to put that in a positive way, the true meaning of the biblical text for us is what God originally intended it to mean when it was first spoken. This is the starting point.

They must be stamped out before they take hold, like flames licking around. What do these lies do? They create doubt. And how do we combat doubt? By exercising and building faith! But how do we do this?\nWhat is faith anyway? Those who think it is an intellectual acceptance of some revealed truth are so far away from real understanding. Faith is a life lived upon the foundation of this truth from the Lord, upon Christ himself, fully committed, trusting and even depending on him to keep his promises. (And he will.) So, how to do this?\nRuthless consistency is again the key. I have to ask myself with brutal honesty, does my life reflect that I will one day stand before the Lord and give an account? Does my life reflect that I have understood Jesus teaching and am living by it in full obedience to him, joyously surrendered? Many seem not to understand this and then wonder why their faith is so small and why doubt is creeping in. Half-hearted belief is no belief at all.\nConsider even this one thing that Jesus said.\nBut many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.\n‚Äï Matthew 19:30 The context of this is the rich young ruler, earnestly seeking but tragically unable to give up this life\u0026rsquo;s riches and pleasures for the Kingdom, just like so many today. Why is it that even within the church so many are trying to be first? Do we really not believe Jesus?\nBut seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.\n‚Äï Matthew 6:33 We may need some help with this. So let us ask our Heavenly Father, who loves us beyond imagining.\nOpen my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.\n‚Äï Psalm 119:18 May this be our most earnest prayer as we learn to wield the shield of faith and extinguish those flaming arrows. And let us observe the Lord\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness in our lives as we live this life of faith, recognising that his faithfulness is in fact the ultimate faith builder.\nTake up your shield of faith, Amy, and know that he who promised is faithful! üôè\n","date":"2022-07-27T06:24:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-shield-of-faith/Cap-s_Shield_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_311336_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-shield-of-faith/","title":"The shield of faith"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nAs we come to what Paul says about feet, I have been contemplating, what is it that feet do?

May they encourage your heart.\nFirstly, the armour of God is all about being prepared for battle. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t the gospel of peace seem to be somewhat at odds with that? I was prompted to reread Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins\u0026rsquo; rousing eve-of-battle speech in the Iraq War. It is not long, but too much to include here in its entirety‚∏∫I encourage you to look it up. I was struck by the juxtaposition of ferocity and compassion, of the warrior on a mission of mercy.\n‚ÄúWe go to liberate, not to conquer. We will not fly our flags in their country. We are entering Iraq to free a people and the only flag which will be flown in that ancient land is their own.\n‚ÄúShow respect for them.\n‚ÄúIf you are ferocious in battle remember to be magnanimous in victory.‚Äù\n‚Äï Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins, Fort¬†Blair¬†Mayne, Kuwait, 19¬†March¬†2003 And so it is with the spiritual battle.\nOur struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\n‚Äï Ephesians 6:12 Those who seem to be our adversaries in this world are really not. We are bringers of the gospel of peace, and we go to liberate. May compassion define us in the battle.\nSecondly, our feet must be fitted with readiness. Who can say when the Lord will choose to act with power and mercy by his Spirit in the lives of those around us? Let us anticipate that he will, and be ready.\nPut on the full armour of God, Amy, and fit your dancing, going feet with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace! üôè\n","date":"2022-07-20T06:25:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-shoes-of-the-gospel-of-peace/ben-weber-8W-p8SS6NJE-unsplash_huee9fb8ec3eee8b29d7dd6dbc0d771113_3331199_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-shoes-of-the-gospel-of-peace/","title":"The shoes of the gospel of peace"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the breastplate of righteousness, exactly?\nStand firm then \u0026hellip; with the breastplate of righteousness in place \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Ephesians 6:14 Obviously the function of the breastplate is to protect the torso, the heart and lungs, those vital organs without which we cannot live. But what is the nature of this righteousness without which we cannot live before the Lord? It is interesting to see how writers disagree about this, because there are two possible answers.\nIn the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last.\n‚Äï Romans 1:17 This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\n‚Äï Romans 3:22 The first view is that the breastplate is Christ\u0026rsquo;s righteousness imputed to us, a free gift of grace received entirely through faith. We can stand firm irrespective of our own wretchedness and sin and failure because of this righteousness from God.\nThere is profound truth in this. But there is another view.\nBut thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted. You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.\n‚Äï Romans 6:17-18 Jesus said,\n‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, whoever keeps my word will never see death.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:51 Being slaves to righteousness and living in total surrender and complete obedience to God is about our sanctification, and ultimately our works, as we are transformed into the likeness of Christ and live lives that reflect that. Faith or works? Are these contradictory? Jim Packer has a helpful explanation.\nFinal judgment, as we saw, will be according to our works‚∏∫that is, our doings, our whole course of life. The relevance of our \u0026lsquo;doings\u0026rsquo; is not that they ever merit an award from the court‚∏∫they are too far short of perfection to do that‚∏∫but that they provide an index of what is in the heart.\nIt is not that one way of acting was meritorious while the other was not, but that from these actions one can tell whether there was love to Christ, the love that springs from faith, in the heart.\n‚Äï J.I. Packer, Knowing God, Chapter 14 James takes up this very idea.\nShow me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.\n‚Äï James 2:18 And now we can see it clearly. The righteousness is Christ\u0026rsquo;s alone, freely given and received through faith by us who believe, and initiating in us an ongoing transformation into slaves to righteousness. Through this we live ever more radically changed lives, and through this we have assurance of salvation. The merit is all Christ\u0026rsquo;s and so is the glory. Praise him!\nStand firm in the battle, Amy, wholly depending on Christ\u0026rsquo;s righteousness imputed to you, and have assurance of that by the evidence of your own transformed life! üôè\n","date":"2022-07-13T07:25:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-breastplate-of-righteousness/Lorica_segmentata_huc7c302d320f9daf7da18eefbe62fe604_1015641_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-breastplate-of-righteousness/","title":"The breastplate of righteousness"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nThank you so much for last week\u0026rsquo;s email‚∏∫what a lot has been going on!

You know how I love to unpack these things! I\u0026rsquo;ll start with this:\nStand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled round your waist \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Ephesians 6:14a How vital is truth. We\u0026rsquo;ll come to some specifics, but firstly, have you wondered why Paul represents truth as a belt? Why a belt?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I found when I looked into it.\nThe cingulum was the traditional Roman soldier\u0026rsquo;s belt, which only soldiers were allowed to wear, and which they wore even when off duty. The leather straps (baltea) dangling from the front of the belt with their decorative studs (bullae) were the only insignia on their uniform. The belt was about identity.\nAnd so it is with the belt of truth. It is our fundamental identity in Christ, upon which everything else hangs.\nThe Christian\u0026rsquo;s identity is in truth‚∏∫truth in who we are and truth in our status before God, sinners saved by grace.\nThere is no difference \u0026hellip; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.\n‚Äï Romans 3:22b-24 In the spiritual battle, when Satan accuses and we are tempted to despair of who we are, we must hold onto this truth: our Heavenly Father already knows the very worst about us, yet still he loves.\nGod demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\n‚Äï Romans 5:8 This is our identity, and our identity is in Christ. Only by holding onto this are we able to stand firm in the spiritual battle.\nTherefore, if anyone is in Christ, he or she is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 5:17 Stand firm in this truth, Amy, which is your identity in Christ! üôè\n","date":"2022-07-06T06:24:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-belt-of-truth/Roman_cingulum_1_hu68cb47ef129d42652b1360f6ab60930e_166174_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-belt-of-truth/","title":"The belt of truth"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is even harder than forgiving those whose sin against us is breathtakingly heinous? Here\u0026rsquo;s what: forgiving ourselves.\nIt could be said that part of growing up is having to learn to live with the consequences of one\u0026rsquo;s own mistakes, consequences which can be far-reaching indeed. But learning to live with and forgiving are quite different.\nMistakes and wilful sins are also quite different. But when all the confessing and repenting is done, the endpoint may be the same: agonizing regret over the life that has been lost, what was and is no longer, or what was once hoped for but never came to be.\nLet us remind ourselves why Jesus came.\nI have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\n‚Äï John 10:10b But how can those grieving over such a loss experience this?\nFirstly we must repudiate any suggestion that the rescued life is in any sense second class.\nWho will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who then is the one who condemns?\n‚Äï Romans 8:33-34a Me? Is it me that condemns? Is it me that contradicts the Lord of all creation over his declaration of my righteousness in Christ? What am I thinking? Who am I to think that my own judgment is the one that matters?\nAnd secondly there is this.\nThis is what the LORD says \u0026hellip;\n‚ÄúForget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:16, 18-19 In the wasteland which is my life, the Lord is doing a new thing, which is springing up, even now. Streams of living water. A way in the desert.\nLonging for what is past is incongruous. The lesson of history is that the Lord does not go back. What is lost is ultimately no loss. It has become a shrivelled, dead thing. There is a new thing springing up which is alive and exciting. Joseph experienced this. Job experienced it, finally‚∏∫the goodness and kindness and overflowing generosity of the Lord, who does not disappoint.\nAnd so, this is how I can forgive myself and let go of the past. I surrender, Lord, not only to your plans and purposes for my life, but to your declaration that I am a new creation in Christ. The old is gone, the new is come, and I stand before you in Christ\u0026rsquo;s righteousness!

This is not optional, it is commanded by Jesus.\n‚ÄúIf your brother or sister sins, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying \u0026lsquo;I repent\u0026rsquo;, you must forgive them.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 17:3-4 I am facing a situation in which this is a real challenge. The response I received to my articulated desire for reconciliation and relationship and mutual forgiveness and healing was a crushing and callous brush-off. What now?\nMy first attempt to forgive was a false start. I tried to diminish the magnitude of the offence, to find a way to receive it as a simple misunderstanding, to excuse the other\u0026rsquo;s behaviour. This failed because there was no truth in it. The behaviour was in fact wretched and reprehensible. I cannot deny it.\nI then had to grapple with ‚Äúif they repent‚Äù. In my situation, there is no repentance. There is stubborn and Pharisaical judgment and rejection, and refusal to engage in authentic relationship. It is crushing. Heartbreaking.\nSome writers have tried to argue that the requirement to forgive is conditional on repentance, and in this passage it indeed appears so. Is that the whole story though? I think not. But let\u0026rsquo;s not resort to a human argument.\nConsider this from the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer, and what Jesus said next in the Sermon on the Mount:\nAnd forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.\nFor if you forgive others when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\n‚Äï Matthew 6:12, 14-15 Here our forgiveness of others is linked to God\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness of us no less. How vital then is it to forgive!\nAnd what of this?\nWhen they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals‚∏∫one on his right, the other on his left. Jesus said, ‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 23:33-34a Was there repentance here? Of course not! How are we called to live? Like Christ! And how can we find the power to do this? Only in him!\nTo do this I must die to self, again. But as I do, I find I am being transformed into Christ\u0026rsquo;s likeness. There is no greater joy, even in the midst of all this pain. The joy in that transformation is empowering indeed!\nThis is a lengthy process, an ongoing journey, and I am not yet done. May the Lord have mercy on that individual as I forgive, and continue to forgive, dying to self and becoming like Christ. And if they come to the point of repentance, may we be restored in authentic relationship again, by Christ\u0026rsquo;s power and for his glory.\nLive like Christ, Amy, in him and by his power and for his glory, fuelled by the joy in your own transformation! üôè\n","date":"2022-06-22T08:00:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/forgiving-others/madhu-shesharam-KQZZCVyEWVk-unsplash_hu8642bb43102fde55e6de8f6d3ce95497_1638295_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/forgiving-others/","title":"Forgiving others"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHave you ever chosen to take the opposite view than the one you would naturally hold, and found insight?

I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.\u0026rsquo;\n‚ÄúBut the tax collector stood at a distance.

Recall Tim Keller\u0026rsquo;s definition: ‚ÄúThe fear of the Lord is a reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done.‚Äù\nIf the Lord of all creation loves me to the extent that he gave up his only Son to an excruciating death in order to rescue me, and has promised abundant life and ongoing rescue in him, the only rational response is to completely cast myself upon his love, trusting him, absolutely. Anything less betrays a lack of understanding of the eternal reality. (Sadly it seems to me that few indeed are able to rationalize to this extent.)\nWhat does this rational response look like then? Here\u0026rsquo;s what. Diving headfirst into the wellspring of life. Living confidently on the firm foundation of such a promise from the Lord. Ruthless consistency is the key which unlocks the understanding to be able to live like this.\nAnd so radical faith in the one who is faithful and true is in fact the only way to live with intellectual integrity. Having tested it, we must lean into it as the foundation of our life. Nothing else makes any sense.\nLive with radical faith, Amy, employing all of your intellect to live a life increasingly aligned with your growing knowledge of the Holy One! üôè\n","date":"2022-05-18T06:23:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/faith-vs-reason/dan-cristian-padure-h3kuhYUCE9A-unsplash_hu82c25fa98cd4e9a8103220017be4b8cb_1271872_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/faith-vs-reason/","title":"Faith vs reason"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the nature of the comfort we can receive from God, and how can we receive it?\nLife can be so hard. We need this comfort. So we need to understand just what it is, and how it works. Paul tells us.\nPraise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 I gained some insight into this recently, quite indirectly and unexpectedly. Just as I was arriving back home from a run, I bumped into a friend, a professor of theology with whom I have had some interesting and uplifting conversations over the years. I remarked that I had been struck by the incredible grace and kindness of the Lord. He then asked an interesting question: ‚ÄúDid something particularly good just happen?‚Äù to which the answer was no, not at all.\nAs I reflected on this later, it made me a little sad. So often, the grace of God is understood as being received through our circumstances, equated with something good and pleasant happening to us. How impoverished can be our understanding of grace! The grace of God is a powerful, tangible thing, which can be received and experienced in its own right, independently of any change in circumstance. And invisible to others, save perhaps for some glow about us as we receive it.\nAnd so it is with comfort. If we read around those verses we see the context of the comfort is severe hardship, hardly pleasant circumstances. In particular, note this.\nFor just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.\n‚Äï v5 Suffering and comfort here are hand-in-hand. This comfort from God is not received through observable, physical happenings. It is received directly. It is wonderful, powerful, and oh so tangible, a gift from the Father of compassion himself. A heavenly hug, so to speak, from the one who loves us beyond measure.\nWhatever is happening, Amy, receive comfort directly from the God of all comfort, the Father of compassion, the one who loves you beyond imagining! üôè\n","date":"2022-05-11T06:24:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-god-of-all-comfort/helena-lopes-ikOKjyLZRno-unsplash_hu76351e6f8797b0da2895aa28e50712f1_2323076_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-god-of-all-comfort/","title":"The God of all comfort"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can a floating axe-head provide insight into the Father-heart of God?\n[Elisha and his servants and the company of the prophets] went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees [to build a place for them to live]. As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axe-head fell into the water. ‚ÄúOh, my lord,‚Äù he cried out, ‚Äúit was borrowed!‚Äù\nThe man of God asked, ‚ÄúWhere did it fall?‚Äù When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float. ‚ÄúLift it out,‚Äù he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.\n‚Äï 2 Kings 6:4-7 What a curious little account. How are we to understand it? Firstly, let\u0026rsquo;s note just what a man of God Elisha was. When Elijah was handing down to him the mantle of being the Lord\u0026rsquo;s prophet, Elisha asked to inherit a double portion of his spirit. (How cheeky was that? ‚Äî 2 Kings 2:1-15) He certainly received it!\nBack to the axe-head then. Losing an axe-head would have been no small matter‚∏∫there was certainly no Mitre 10 Mega to provide a replacement. And consider the shame of losing borrowed equipment, especially something so valuable. But still, surely a trivial thing in the light of eternity? Why would the Lord even care? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t he be more concerned with the learning and growth opportunity afforded by suffering such a loss? Isn\u0026rsquo;t this life supposed to be about learning to suffer and submit to such? How easily we could fail to understand the Father-heart of God!\nWhat do we actually see revealed here then? Here\u0026rsquo;s what. A lavish, gratuitously kind and compassionate miraculous response to a material loss. Yes, the man had been careless, and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have let this happen. But it did, and the Lord stepped in with no rebuke, demonstrating through his servant Elisha such affection and concern for one he loved.\nAnd so it is with us. The Lord\u0026rsquo;s kindness and compassion for us is rooted in the reality of our situation. How ready he is to step in and rescue!

We cannot afford to be half-hearted in this. David said as much to his own son.\n‚ÄúAnd you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts.

As you know, I like to ask the big questions, so let\u0026rsquo;s start with that! In fact, Megan and I are in Glenorchy, just about to embark on the Rees-Dart track, so we\u0026rsquo;ll be out of coverage for the next four days, and that\u0026rsquo;s the reason. With that out of the way, let\u0026rsquo;s move on to the next big question. üòÅ\nWhat was the first Easter victory, and how did that lead to the second?\nTwo victories? Yes, really! The first victory was won on the cross, as Jesus died.\nJesus said, ‚ÄúIt is finished.‚Äù With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.\n‚Äï John 19:30 Finished here means completed, fulfilled, accomplished. A triumphant, ‚ÄúI have done it!‚Äù This is the first victory, won at inconceivable cost, to the Son and the Father both. It is victory over sin, in our lives.\nHow did this lead to the second? Paul explains exactly how.\nYour attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:\nWho, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death‚∏∫even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\n‚Äï Philippians 2:5-11 The how is in the therefore. Jesus made himself obedient even to death on a cross, and therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name. This is the second victory, resurrection victory over death itself, in his life and ours both.\nJust how exalted is Jesus? Every knee should bow, and every tongue confess. Here\u0026rsquo;s John\u0026rsquo;s vision of the end of time:\nThen I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: ‚ÄúTo him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever!‚Äù\nThe four living creatures said, ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù, and the elders fell down and worshipped.\n‚Äï Revelation 5:13-14 Fall down with them, Amy, and worship the one who is worthy to receive praise and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever! üôèüôå\n","date":"2022-04-19T09:11:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/two-victories/jordan-wozniak-xP_AGmeEa6s-unsplash_hu90d7b379905df321a5a17b1bf0e1d1c4_3817667_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/two-victories/","title":"Two victories"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the turning point in the Easter story?\nIn fact there are two. We\u0026rsquo;ll come to the joyous second, but let\u0026rsquo;s not rush that. Now is the time to contemplate the mournful first.\nI have been reading Mark\u0026rsquo;s account of the last days of Jesus\u0026rsquo; life, from the triumphal entry into Jerusalem up until his death on the cross (Mark 11-15). There\u0026rsquo;s much that happens, starting with Jesus clearing the temple, which had become a den of robbers. We see Jesus speaking and acting with power and authority. Until we don\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe turning point is signalled when Jesus is before the high priest, being interrogated. Being accused.\nBut Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.\n‚Äï Mark 14:61 Haven\u0026rsquo;t you wondered about that? In fact Mark records here only one statement from Jesus.\nAgain the high priest asked him, ‚ÄúAre you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am,‚Äù said Jesus. ‚ÄúAnd you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 14:61-62 Mark records Jesus speaking only once more, confirming Pilate\u0026rsquo;s description of him, in his words as the king of the Jews. And after this, nothing.\nAnd this is the turning point, over which I have been weeping. After confirming that he is indeed the Lord of all creation, from here on Jesus is no longer the one who does anything at all. Having given up all the power and authority which are his by right, he is now simply one who is done to. He makes himself nothing but the object of others\u0026rsquo; actions, completely and absolutely surrendered to their will, to the Father\u0026rsquo;s will, like a lamb to the slaughter. And we read a factual, brutal account of what was done to him, culminating in this.\nThey brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means ‚Äúthe place of the skull‚Äù).\nAnd they crucified him.\n‚Äï Mark 15:22, 24 The Lord of all creation, humiliated. Pierced. Crushed. Extinguished. The object of God\u0026rsquo;s wrath. But let us be clear about what was happening. Just before he died, Jesus cried out in anguish:\n‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 15:34 I know the answer to this.

Last week we came upon just such a realisation. I can\u0026rsquo;t do better than to share the extract which had this effect on me.\nIf a father continues cheerful and carefree while his son is getting into trouble, or if a husband remains unmoved when his wife is in distress, we wonder at once how much love there can be in their relationship, for we know that those who truly love are only happy when those whom they love are truly happy also. So it is with God in his love for us.\n‚Äï J.I. Packer, Knowing God, Chapter 12, The Love of God Already this is giving us an inkling that there could be something truly profound about the nature of God\u0026rsquo;s love that we may have overlooked. Packer continues.\nThrough setting his love on human beings God has voluntarily bound up his own final happiness with theirs.\n‚Äï J.I. Packer Oh my! Could he really have done this? I am mind-blown already.\nHe has set his love upon particular sinners, and this means that, by his own free voluntary choice, he will not know perfect and unmixed happiness again till he has brought every one of them to heaven. He has in effect resolved that henceforth for all eternity his happiness shall be conditional upon ours.\n‚Äï J.I. Packer It is almost beyond comprehension that the Lord would do this. How much pain, searing, lasting pain, has he taken upon himself in this decision? How much of his joy is now tied up in ours? What kind of love is this? What kind of God is this?\nThus God saves, not only for his glory, but also for his gladness. This goes far to explain why it is that there is joy (God\u0026rsquo;s own joy) in the presence of the angels when a sinner repents (Luke 15:10), and why there will be exceeding joy when God sets us faultless at the last day in his own holy presence (Jude v24). The thought passes understanding and almost beggars belief, but there is no doubt that according to Scripture, such is the love of God.\n‚Äï J.I.

He earnestly sought the Lord and wrote many of the psalms which have blessed the generations. But let us not make the mistake of thinking that he was a righteous man. His later life was in fact a catalogue of failure and shame, culminating in his most shabby and shameful moral failure, committing adultery with Bathsheba and murdering her husband Uriah the Hittite (2¬†Samuel¬†11).\nPreviously, David wrote Psalm 3 when he was being pursued by his son Absalom, who was trying to kill him and seize control of the kingdom. What greater failure as a father could there be than that? How utterly shameful.\nAnd yet we read this.\nBut you, LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high.\n‚Äï Psalm 3:3 David was so aware that he had no glory of his own.

It is a glorious, majestic work featuring players both unwilling and willing, with plunging depths and soaring heights, human folly and heavenly beneficence, sorrow and joy. It is a love story, the greatest of them all, a story of rescue and redemption of a wayward people, pieced together from fragments of ruined lives made whole.\nAs the billions of orchestral members play their parts with quite some improvising, the Lord hears the prayers of the saints, our prayers, and delights to weave them in to the score, making amendments and annotations with his divine pencil even as the music unfolds, taking our imperfect petitions and making them part of his perfect plans and purposes, as it pleases him. And with each, smiling down on his beloved ones with such affection, like a proud father.

In these days in which we live perhaps it is one of Satan\u0026rsquo;s most potent weapons to bring division in the world, and even between the people of God. Live differently. Paul tells us how, and we only just considered this. As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.\n‚Äï Ephesians 4:1-3 Bearing with one another in love is the key. This is the opposite of offence-taking. What does it look like, this bearing with one another, in love?\nTo bear with someone means to be patient, to be tolerant. We are all imperfect, and sometimes we say things that could be misconstrued. Let us receive one another with humility, gentleness and patience, bearing with one another in love. May generous hearts enable us to navigate with wisdom and kindness those pinch points at which offence could so easily be taken. The Lord is glorified as we do, for it is in his Spirit that we are able to do this. Bearing with one another in love is powerfully and relationally healing.\nLive like this, Amy, and know the joy of the Lord in keeping the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace! üôè\n","date":"2022-03-02T06:25:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/taking-offence/martin-olsen-szfPB4X-FWk-unsplash_huac110bd7af19d433ae3d095da2651a8e_8003080_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/taking-offence/","title":"Taking offence"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow is this life like Scooby-Doo?\nEvery Scooby-Doo episode I can remember ends in the same way.

What exactly should I do then? Er \u0026hellip; live honourably, behave well, be kind to strangers, help old ladies across the street? Is this what Paul means? Notice how we bring so much of our own context to understanding a verse. The only way to know is to read the verse in its context. So what is the context here?\nAs a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.\n‚Äï Ephesians 4:1-3 This is the immediate context. The wider context is the whole letter. Paul was writing this letter from Rome, where he was confined ‚Äúfor the Lord‚Äù (Acts 28). Notice what he went through in serving the one he loved, and how much humility he demonstrated, giving up his very freedom for the sake of the ones for whom he was sent.\nReading on, we can understand what his urging means, what is this worthy life to be lived. It is a life of humility, a life to be lived in community with others. None of these attributes can be outworked on our own: humility, gentleness, bearing with one another in love, keeping unity. And note that Paul was able to write with such credibility (‚Äúthen‚Äù) because of the testimony of his own life, his own humility.\nThe word worthy here means appropriate. So they, and we, are urged to live a life appropriate to the calling we have received. What is this calling, this invitation? And why is a life of humility the appropriate response?\nFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚∏∫and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚∏∫not by works, so that no-one can boast.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:8-9 Each of us has been rescued by grace alone, with no merit on our part. The rescue was undeserved and there is no room for boasting.\n(Later in the chapter, Paul goes on to other aspects of living a worthy life. Humility by itself is not enough, of course.

Joshua had to act on the basis that something impossible would happen. (And it did.)\nArguably Abraham had it even harder. He had to wait on an impossible promise, for twenty-five years! Waiting is perhaps harder than doing. And waiting for twenty-five years?!\nThere are other examples in the Bible of God speaking the impossible.

It means that their experience was substantially like our own.\nWe must pray for the faith and for the experiences that would enable us to believe that such things could happen to us. Only then will we be able to recognize, accept and dwell in them when they come.\n‚Äï Dallas Willard, Hearing God, Chapter 2 How then can we receive it when God speaks the impossible? It is in fact a high honour, an invitation to demonstrate radical faith, and to grow in that faith. Perhaps God reserves such things for those for whom he has great plans, which will require great faith. (That\u0026rsquo;s a little scary, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?) No-one starts with such faith, but the Lord in his wisdom knows what he is doing. Again, consider Abraham.\nAnd so I hold on to this verse, which has kept me going for some years, and was itself given to me in a miraculous way.\nGod is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind.

And yet, why is it that we do not live like this? For tragically, we do not. We should be living and breathing this, all the time. Nothing matters more. But what exactly are we supposed to do as we go about our lives?\nA phrase I came upon recently has really got its hooks into me: relational authenticity. This is surely the starting point. Relational authenticity recognises that the one standing before me is a real person, whoever they may be. A real person with their hopes, dreams, disappointments and hurts, just like me. And the choice which is uniquely mine is whether and how to relate, to accept, to love. How do I regard them? As background noise? A diversion? A duty? Someone to look down upon? Someone to avoid? Or a whole person, with all their value and complexity and brokenness, loved by the Lord, as am I?\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more. Relational authenticity demands radical humility.\nThere is no difference \u0026hellip; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.\n‚Äï Romans 3:22-24 How this challenges ego!

And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:21-22 As we develop relational authenticity, this is what we will find: all of us, together, a holy temple in the Lord!\nLet us not overlook that this is the fruit of the Spirit.

There are two vital destinations that can help us grow in self-control, especially in the face of temptation. But first, take note of this.\nGod is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 10:13 We should expect to be tempted. How else will we grow in self-control other than by exercising it? So we should expect also to have to work at this. It won\u0026rsquo;t be easy, obviously, since nothing worthwhile was ever gained like that. Just let us never overlook God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness in enabling us to stand.\nOur first destination in time is just a few minutes into the future. Let us imagine looking back, observing our own behaviour through the lens of hindsight. Do we see someone behaving honourably? Someone displaying strength of character? Someone we are pleased to be? May the Lord\u0026rsquo;s sustaining grace enable us to be that! We must be mindful that our character is defined by the accumulation of every choice that we make, no matter how small or apparently insignificant. The new viewpoint helps enormously with this!\nOur second destination is a little further, at the end of our lives. Let us imagine being welcomed into heaven by our Lord. What is it that I want to hear on that day? I will live my life to hear him say this.\n‚ÄúWell done, good and faithful servant!‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 25:23 Do some time-travelling in your mind, Amy, and live your life to hear him say, ‚ÄúWell done, my good and faithful servant!‚Äù üôè\n","date":"2022-01-12T06:30:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/self-control/peter-herrmann-9_FK2Tp-kLA-unsplash_hu69269329ef5205aa1d81b50dbc9e9331_3329658_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/self-control/","title":"Self-control"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat fuels faithfulness?\nThe fruit of the Spirit is \u0026hellip; faithfulness\n‚Äï Galatians 5:22 Faithfulness is such an honourable character trait, perhaps the noblest of them all. To be loyal, steadfast, trustworthy and true‚∏∫surely these words make our hearts soar. They speak to the very heart of noble character, of character that honours the Lord. So where does faithfulness come from? There are two answers to this.\nFirstly, the Lord\u0026rsquo;s own faithfulness, evident throughout Scripture, from where he first introduces himself to Moses, right up to John\u0026rsquo;s vision on the island of Patmos of the risen Lord Jesus, the rider on the white horse.\nAnd [the LORD] passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin.\n‚Äï Exodus 34:6-7 All the ways of the LORD are loving and faithful for those who keep the demands of his covenant.\n‚Äï Psalm 25:10 For the word of the LORD is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.\n‚Äï Psalm 33:4 Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.\n‚Äï Psalm 36:5 Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope: Because of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.\n‚Äï Lamentations 3:21-23 The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.\n‚Äï 1 Thessalonians 5:24 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.\n‚Äï Hebrews 10:23 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\n‚Äï 1 John 1:9 I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True.\n‚Äï Revelation 19:11 The Lord\u0026rsquo;s own faithfulness to us makes our hearts burn with fire, fuelling our own faithfulness, our noblest thoughts and deeds, through and for him.\nSecondly, consider the word itself, pistis in the original Greek. Mostly that word is not in fact translated as faithfulness, but rather faith.\nPistis ‚Äî persuasion that is credence; moral conviction (of religious truth or the truthfulness of God or a religious teacher) especially reliance upon Christ for salvation; abstractly constancy in such profession; by extension the system of religious (Gospel) truth.\n‚Äï Strong\u0026#39;s Greek Lexicon Faithfulness then is fueled by being full of faith. Genuine, all-in, life-changing faith in the one who is faithful to all he has said, and indeed all he is, gives us the power to live lives that are worthy of our calling, manifesting in the noblest of hearts, and lasting faithfulness.\nLook to him Amy, whose name is Faithful and True, be full of faith, and let that fuel your own faithfulness, to him and for him, forever! üôè\n","date":"2022-01-05T08:00:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/faithfulness/sean-benesh-VnmbcgAfL3Q-unsplash_hu4c9e3431344ffbd35878d4c1321f632c_3305487_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/faithfulness/","title":"Faithfulness"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we choose joy?\nThe fruit of the Spirit is \u0026hellip; joy\n‚Äï Galatians 5:22 Isn\u0026rsquo;t joy something that from time to time lands on us, thrills our heart, and lifts us into the Lord\u0026rsquo;s presence? How can we choose this for ourselves? In fact we can, and understanding this is the key to a deeper, richer, more joyous walk with the Lord, independent of the circumstances of our lives.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a clue in Paul\u0026rsquo;s command (a command, no less!) to the Philippians.\nRejoice in the Lord always.

So, how can we grow in patience in the face of delay?\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m asking an easy question! We grow in this patience by having to wait, and by learning to wait well. But actually waiting well is anything but easy. It is the hardest thing. And it\u0026rsquo;s harder still when we can\u0026rsquo;t understand why. Why the wait?\nIt helps to consider those who waited before us. Like Moses.\nAfter a miraculous escape from being drowned at birth, Moses had a privileged upbringing, growing up in the royal palace of Egypt, learning leadership and what it meant to rule. As a gifted and highly capable forty year old, he thought he was ready to lead his people out of slavery. The Lord had other plans! Moses spent the next forty years tending sheep in the wilderness. We can wonder how long it took him to come to terms with that! I\u0026rsquo;m sure he spent quite some time raging against the apparent pointlessness of his life. But what was the result?\nNow Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.\n‚Äï Numbers 12:3 During those forty years the Lord wrought some fundamental changes in Moses\u0026rsquo; heart. Where else did that humility come from? In that waiting time, Moses had been completely transformed, and was finally ready to be used by the Lord.\nWaiting may feel like death, but in fact it can be a path to abundant life, to the mother lode of spiritual blessing and joy. It is a powerful agency of the Lord to change our heart and grow each one of us into someone who can be of some use in the Kingdom. If we can notice this happening in ourselves as it unfolds, that may help us to wait with patience, and to wait well.\nLearn to wait well, Amy, and grow in patience! üôè\n","date":"2021-11-24T06:25:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/patience-in-waiting/pavlenko-8BNO4HUQYRw-unsplash_hu5fc3c5de92255b47bde5d6171aec2a54_1378295_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/patience-in-waiting/","title":"Patience in waiting"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the most Christlike response we can give to an angry, frustrated, hostile, hurting world?\nThe fruit of the Spirit is \u0026hellip; gentleness\n‚Äï Galatians 5:22-23 The first thing to note about the fruit of the Spirit is that there is only one fruit (‚Äúthe fruit of the Spirit is \u0026hellip;‚Äù), and that fruit has nine characteristics.

The Lord\u0026rsquo;s character is revealed even in this, that he found yet another way to bless us, his beloved. Praise him!\nThis gives us some insight. We experience the goodness of God as a result of taking some action. What action is that?\nIt seems to me that more than any other the word that appears alongside the goodness of God throughout scripture is trust, that those who would see his goodness must trust, in his unfailing love, in his mercy, in all he is and all he has done. Grab a concordance and see for yourself! This very verse continues ‚Äúblessed is the one who takes refuge in him‚Äù.\nIf we would taste and see, we must then trust and depend. This makes sense. When we fully commit to depending on the Lord, such that we are not trying to control our own outcome, only then may we see the goodness of God, because only then have we left him space in which to show us that goodness. As we relinquish control over our own lives, may we learn to chew on and genuinely savour the goodness of God that he reveals to us.\nTrust and depend, Amy, taste and see, and leave the Lord space to show you his goodness! üôè\n","date":"2021-10-20T06:33:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/taste-and-see-that-the-lord-is-good/joyful-vT5xrj3z1OE-unsplash_hu70af4556733b0a236593958d08853f16_711705_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/taste-and-see-that-the-lord-is-good/","title":"Taste and see that the Lord is good"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we relate to our Heavenly Father when he leaves our most earnest and desperate prayers unanswered?\n[Jesus said] ‚ÄúAsk and it will be given to you;\n\u0026hellip; how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 7:7, 11 ‚ÄúYou may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 14:14 But unanswered prayer is a real thing.

It\u0026rsquo;s not wishful thinking, there are actual grounds for believing this. In our context, ‚Äúsomething good‚Äù is understated, to say the least! May the enlightened eyes of our heart know the best thing that could possibly happen.\nOur glorious inheritance in the saints. What is this? In v3 Paul writes that the Lord ‚Äúhas blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ‚Äù. Note the tense. Something has already happened! But what of the rest? The prophetic past tense is used throughout scripture where a future event is so certain it is written as if it had already occurred. The fulfilment of our future blessing in the heavenly realms is that certain.\nHis incomparably great power for us. This is the same power that raised Christ from the dead. It is not a small thing, and it is at work in us who believe! When we feel overwhelmed or empty, and so aware of our need for the Lord\u0026rsquo;s power and grace, perhaps his mighty strength which raised Christ from the dead will be enough. We must know this!\nMay the eyes of your heart be enlightened, Amy, in order that you may know, really know, these life changing things. üôè\n","date":"2021-09-22T06:31:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-eyes-of-your-heart/javardh-FC59Au36moM-unsplash_hud074c3e2071ffe9a2e072d9c155fe27c_1166685_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-eyes-of-your-heart/","title":"The eyes of your heart"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s all this about predestination? Don\u0026rsquo;t people have a right to choose for themselves?\nAs I swing in my hammock on that desert island, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing much to do except read Ephesians 1. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I find.\nHe chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his children through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will \u0026hellip;\nIn him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:4-5, 11-12 There\u0026rsquo;s no escaping that this is the Lord\u0026rsquo;s choice, rather than mine. And that is a wonderful thing. The Lord, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, does not make mistakes. He chose me. He chose you, Amy, in accordance with his pleasure and will. As for me, I make mistakes, and my own choices are always subject to suspicion and doubt. Not so the Lord! His plans and purposes prevail, for the praise of his glory. I, you, we are both his, forever, and no mistake! And thus we have assurance of salvation.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more. He chose us to be holy and blameless in his sight. Partly that is an instantaneous, Jesus-died-for-my sins-and-now-I-am-counted-righteous thing. And partly it is a rest-of-my-life thing, as the Holy Spirit continues both to convict me and to empower me to change, as I surrender my will on the pathway to holiness. Both are life-giving, lavish gifts.\nBut what of evangelism? If people are chosen, where is repentance and belief? See what comes next in the passage.\nAnd you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God‚Äôs possession‚∏∫to the praise of his glory.\n‚Äï Ephesians 1:13-14 Those to whom Paul writes heard the message of truth (because someone told them), and believed.

The Lord had given victory to Syria through Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army (v1, how interesting), who suffered from leprosy. Previously, the Syrians had taken captives from Israel, and among them was a young girl, now a slave in the house of Naaman (v2). Not even named, and yet her faith makes her the hero of this story. How would you expect a young girl, captive in a foreign land, to live? Not like this, surely!\nShe said to her mistress, ‚ÄúIf only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy‚Äù (v3). Talk about not playing it safe and keeping your head down! What can we learn?\nShe was simply and humbly living her life, a slave in Naaman\u0026rsquo;s house, with no resentment or discontent. She had a generous heart, wishing good and not harm upon her captors. She had such a conviction that through Elisha the Lord would heal Naaman the commander of the army of a hostile nation, that she was prepared to put herself on the line. Why did she speak out like this? What trouble would have come her way if there had not been a miraculous healing? Certainly the king of Israel himself expected the outcome to be conflict between nations (v7). Her faith is ridiculous. And so she is the reason that a pagan general\u0026rsquo;s life is turned around, he becomes a worshipper of the Lord, and takes his faith back to a pagan land, into the royal palace, no less (v18).\nWe have to conclude that the Lord placed this on her heart, as he does. These were his plans and purposes, and they rested on the faith of a humble slave girl, who otherwise might simply have been living in obscurity. And on her obedience, oh my!

Let\u0026rsquo;s consider three aspects of a little child\u0026rsquo;s relationship with their earthly parents, and infer how to receive from our Heavenly Father.\nFirstly, the little child trusts, absolutely. When the parent says it is so, or tells of something they will do, the child never doubts for a moment. The child wastes no energy at all worrying about it. They count on it, as if it were already so.\nSecondly, the little child depends, completely. In fact their life makes no sense unless the parent provides, protects, cares, loves. They are wholly dependent. It is the very nature of the relationship.\nThirdly, have you ever observed a little child anticipating something to come, something wonderful, like Christmas? They are so excited! The expectation can be almost too much to bear. And as the event approaches, the excitement grows, contagiously.\nLet us receive the kingdom of God like this. Our Heavenly Father is utterly reliable, and so very good. We can wholly lean on him, fully committed.

Personally, I doubt it was any disability, of speech or of stature, nor any severe pain to endure. Rather I suspect it was something utterly shameful and humiliating, perhaps something in his own character. Something internal and deeply personal. Why do I think this?\nIn every other respect, Paul was the elite. Highly educated. Highly disciplined. Highly capable. Zealous. Purging every sin and making every effort to live a right life (Acts¬†22:3, Phil¬†3:4-6). These are not attributes that lead to humility! They are more likely to lead to arrogance, to smug self-satisfaction, to a sense of moral superiority. How can such a one be depending completely on the Lord, and be of any use in the Kingdom?\nPaul rather was able to live with so much humility and dependence on the Lord because of this (‚Äúin order to keep me from becoming conceited‚Äù, 2¬†Cor¬†12:7), being able to say, ‚ÄúChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners‚∏∫of whom I am the worst‚Äù (1¬†Tim¬†1:15).

Oh how I need him! I am not condemned. But in the rescue and the redemption, all pride is gone. My grateful heart loves the Lord, and seeks to honour him. And so I can live with levels of humility, gentleness and compassion which eluded me previously. The Lord is glorified, and I am diminished. I can die to self, and live for him, holding nothing back.

Is he mocking us? Is he exaggerating? Is he lying, even?\nWhen someone tells us something that is hard to accept, how we receive it depends critically on who they are, and what we know of them.

I\u0026rsquo;m quite a slow learner, and have doubted in various ways for so much of my life, but no longer. I choose therefore to believe that Jesus was telling the truth when he said this impossible thing. What do I make of it then?

How should we approach them?\nMy intention this week was to write about telling a mountain to throw itself into the sea, not doubting. But when I looked into the context, I found that Jesus said it after cursing the fig tree on approaching Jerusalem for the last week of his life. How do we understand that? Let\u0026rsquo;s think about that first, and I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to the mountain another time.\nThe next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, ‚ÄúMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.‚Äù And his disciples heard him say it.\nIn the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.\n‚Äï Mark 11:12-14, 20 How is this reasonable? It was not the season for figs! This seems so harsh. It is certainly hard to understand. What should we do with passages like this?\nFirstly, we ought not to anthropomorphize the tree. It was just a tree. It served a purpose, to illustrate a teaching point of Jesus. Nobody suffered in the making of this point. But still!\nThe worst comment I read about this explained that first fruits appear early, and Jesus would have expected there to be figs for that reason. But Mark would have known that, and would have said, there were no first fruits. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t the reason given! Let us not second guess the gospel writers. The Lord is responsible for his own reputation, and has no need of our defence, no need of our pitiful attempts to make him look good. Let us not brush aside these difficulties with bogus explanations.\nJesus was about to suffer and die, for the sins of all humanity. This was God\u0026rsquo;s plan, and it required rejection and brutal treatment of the Son of God by those who should have been fruitful for the Kingdom, but were not. Was the fig tree a symbol of the Jews who rejected Jesus? It was not their season to be fruitful, and they were severely judged. Is this harsh? It is a hard teaching!\nWe cannot claim perfect understanding of the mysteries of God. But as we grapple, let us do so with intellectual integrity, being faithful to Scripture, and honouring the Lord.

He is the Creator, Almighty, Sovereign Lord, infinite in power and wisdom. He loves us his children absolutely, and he blesses us richly and without bounds. May we never doubt that! And may we never limit our praying to what seems reasonable. If someone is sick, shame on me if I pray merely for their comfort rather than for miraculous healing.\nTo live with such expectation makes me so vulnerable, though. Vulnerable to disappointment. Vulnerable to the scorn of the sceptics. Vulnerable and defenceless. How can my faith survive this?\nRecall that Abraham was strengthened in his faith (Rom¬†4:20). It is a work of the Lord.

Even for the Christian seeking the Lord with all of our heart, living a surrendered life, putting him first in everything, things may not turn out as we would have wished. And that\u0026rsquo;s not just small things. The whole course of one\u0026rsquo;s life could turn out to be so different from what was desired. Where is our loving Heavenly Father in this? Does he not want to bless his children? Absolutely he does! So what is going on?\nPaul wrote to the Romans this oft-quoted verse:\nAnd we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.\n‚Äï Romans 8:28 Let\u0026rsquo;s consider that in the context of Solomon\u0026rsquo;s wisdom:\nIn his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.\n‚Äï Proverbs 16:9 Everyone has hopes and desires for their own life. Some may be sufficiently well organised to have a plan! But the Lord determines their steps. It is his plans and purposes that prevail. Let us not delude ourselves that we can control our own destiny, and somehow plan our way there. That is for the Lord.\nIt is important to dispel a misconception. Paul is not saying that everything that happens is good and is caused by God. That is observably false‚∏∫terrible things do happen. Rather he is saying that whatever happens, God works in it and through it ‚Äúfor the good of those who love him‚Äù. Let us be those!\nLet us learn to see the world through the lens of Romans 8:28 as it actually is then. May we consciously receive God\u0026rsquo;s grace in all that happens. ‚ÄúIn all things‚Äù let us submit to his superior wisdom, knowing that there is no better eternal outcome than the one he has for us. When apparent disappointments come, let us receive them with a grateful heart. The Lord has seen things that we have not. His love is unfailing. He may very well be rescuing us from something we thought was better, but is in fact not. He is the one who determines our steps, and it is very good.\nReceive his grace with a grateful heart in all things, Amy! üôè\n","date":"2021-06-23T06:32:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/experiencing-grace/denise-jans-IJy2ZUex0-Y-unsplash_hu4e149fd970c8df355b517c83a22975b1_2547074_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/experiencing-grace/","title":"Experiencing grace"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat happens when we walk by faith?\nPerhaps the greatest example we have is Abraham. He didn\u0026rsquo;t always get it right, nor did he manage always to trust, as shown by his shabby little misdeed with Hagar. Evidently not super-human then! But the Lord called him again out of that particular failure thirteen years later, out of the absolute mess he had made (‚Äúwalk before me and be blameless‚Äù - Gen¬†17:1), after he had been waiting for the fulfilment of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s promise to him for 25 years. Twenty-five years!\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s account in Romans 4 manages to overlook Abraham\u0026rsquo;s shameful failure (oh the grace of God!), and we find this:\nYet Abraham did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.\n‚Äï Romans 4:20-21 He believed again, and walked by faith. What then happened? He was strengthened in his faith. Notice what happened here. He believed. He exercised faith. Just enough. Perhaps barely enough, but enough all the same.

And it was God who was thus glorified, not Abraham.\nBut the most striking consequence is found just before this.\nAgainst all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations.\n‚Äï Romans 4:18 Notice that little word, so.

That would be a long list to be sure. I\u0026rsquo;ll pick one thing.\nRecently I got to see Les Mis√©rables at the Regent. What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad‚∏∫I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears. The saddest song? Some would say I Dreamed a Dream, and that is indeed crushing (‚Äúnow life has killed the dream I dreamed‚Äù), or On My Own, √âponine\u0026rsquo;s song of unrequited love for Marius (‚Äúthe trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers‚Äù). But there is another: Javert\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy, Stars.\nJavert is the policeman who pursues the protagonist Jean Valjean through the decades, after he breaks parole from a 19 year sentence of slavery for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Valjean receives unexpected grace and repents (‚ÄúI feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?‚Äù). Thus he begins a sacrificial life of love, but Javert cannot accept this. Stars is his vow to pursue Valjean and never rest until he is again behind bars. He sings, ‚Äúmine is the way of the Lord‚Äù (he is so wrong), and ‚Äúthose who falter and those who fall must pay the price‚Äù (wrong again, Javert ‚Äî Rom¬†8:1-4, 31-39).\nAn isolated sad event cannot be a tragedy, no matter how heart-rending, as explained by Educating Rita\u0026rsquo;s teacher. Rather, a tragedy is the long and apparently inescapable trajectory of a life, set in motion by a particular course of events or an attitude of the heart, leading inexorably to one\u0026rsquo;s own destruction. It is the prolonged inevitability which makes it so. Javert eventually takes his own life, the only possible consequence given his Pharisaical heart, hardened over so many years.\nMany today live Javert\u0026rsquo;s life, bereft of grace. Each one is a tragedy, and each one breaks our Father\u0026rsquo;s heart.\nLove with the Father\u0026rsquo;s love, Amy! üôè\n","date":"2021-05-26T06:46:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-pharisaical-heart/tamara-gore-P4mxBJtINCw-unsplash_hu46510db4cb279d99173f70d632c69551_381707_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-pharisaical-heart/","title":"The Pharisaical heart"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWho am I?\nWhat a vital question that is for any of us.

Because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t just happen. It takes serious get-up-early-and-cry-out-to-God hard work, every single day. Work. But not without incredible joy.\nPsalm 119 helps. I won\u0026rsquo;t quote it here, because, well, it\u0026rsquo;s quite long. I have been including the first 32 verses in my daily readings for several years now. (From time to time I read the whole psalm; it is worth it.) I find these qualities in the psalmist. Earnest. Longing. Disciplined. Realistic. Falling short. Being held. Fully surrendered.\nThese verses conclude, I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free (v32). I pray that you may increasingly run in the path of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s commands like this. üôè\n","date":"2021-03-17T06:33:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/how-to-grow-in-reverent-awe-and-wonder/atharva-tulsi-2jA_YoQuvaA-unsplash_hu529b24a8d1cb8f3351f529a0a5b3e71a_270531_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/how-to-grow-in-reverent-awe-and-wonder/","title":"How to grow in reverent awe and wonder"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we know the will of the Lord?

The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them (v14).\nTim Keller defines the fear of the Lord as this, in a sermon from Proverbs on the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom. \u0026ldquo;The fear of the Lord is a reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done.\u0026rdquo;\nMy prayer for you is that you learn to live this more each day. üôè\n","date":"2021-03-10T06:43:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/fear-of-the-lord-is-the-beginning-of-wisdom/greg-rakozy-oMpAz-DN-9I-unsplash_hu392a82e53b5525744bacaa1cbe4161b9_2745686_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/fear-of-the-lord-is-the-beginning-of-wisdom/","title":"Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHere are a couple of verses from Psalm 25 for you:\nGood and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.
