[{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhy is it that some seem to receive more bounteous blessing from the Lord than others? How is that fair? And how is it congruent with a God of justice?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with fair, and let\u0026rsquo;s be frank. What would be fair would be for each one of us to be cast into the fiery pit. And collectively, we must take responsibility through our wretched ancestors for much of the suffering of humankind, for we share the same rebellious spirit.\n ‚ÄúBecause you have \u0026hellip; eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‚ÄòYou shall not eat of it,‚Äô cursed is the ground because of you.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 3:17 But, and this is a wonderful, unmerited, joyous but,\n If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\n‚Äï 1 John 1:9 What a rescue! What a Saviour! Praise him!\nSo, with grateful, praising hearts, in fear and trembling, let us dare to ask again, how is it that God\u0026rsquo;s blessing is quite so unevenly distributed?\nPaul grappled with such a question in relation to the election of the gentiles and God\u0026rsquo;s apparent rejection of the nation of Israel (Romans 9-11). That he takes three chapters over this shows us that such questions are no small matter.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take some of his arguments and apply them to the more general question of uneven blessing.\n What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God\u0026rsquo;s part? By no means! For he says to Moses, ‚ÄúI will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.‚Äù\n‚Äï Romans 9:14-15 It is all mercy, and it is all undeserved. And let us not forget that the giver is the Creator God of the Universe.\n Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honourable use and another for dishonourable use? What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory.\n‚Äï Romans 9:21-23 Somehow in the unevenness of the blessing, God is making known the riches of his glory. Paul also shows us how to respond in the face of the apparent injustice of it all.\n Brothers, my heart\u0026rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.\n‚Äï Romans 10:1 And observe the extent of his love.\n I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers.\n‚Äï Romans 9:2-3 Is this then the key to understanding? Even as we cry out to God over the unevenness of the blessing, is this our opportunity to learn how to truly love, and in so doing to glorify God?\nJesus said,\n ‚ÄúI was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 25:35-36, 40 May the Lord enlarge our hearts for this broken world as we look around and see places where his blessing seems to be absent. And let us cry out to him for mercy, to the Lord, our Heavenly Father.\nIn case you think we have arrived at a place of only partial understanding, let us observe that Paul himself, the great apostle and teacher, is in just that place after three chapters of his own wrestling.\n Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!\nFor from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.\n‚Äï Romans 11:33, 36 Cry out, Amy, to the one who is wise beyond understanding, and in places of meagre blessing love with his own love, from him and through him and to him, for his glory forever! üôè\n","date":"2022-09-21T06:24:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/uneven-blessing/atul-pandey-0f3bZHXZSz8-unsplash_hu6ab3cbe815f652dee992b957c8e8fd6a_1513446_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/uneven-blessing/","title":"Uneven blessing"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nCan sorrow ever be a good thing?\nWhat of this, that Paul writes to the Corinthians?\n Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 7:8 Was Paul somehow pleased with himself because he stuck it to those wretched Corinthians in his first letter? By no means!\n Yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 7:9 Their sorrow was as God intended and led to repentance. This is Godly sorrow, and the Lord uses it to expose sin in our lives to bring repentance and healing.\nWhen I weep over the shame and failure in my life and cry out to the Lord, this also is Godly sorrow, a gift of love from my Heavenly Father, received through the conviction that comes by the Holy Spirit. It drives me into the arms of my loving Heavenly Father, from shame to repentance and forgiveness and healing, and is, through the healing, eventually and ultimately, a cause for rejoicing in my wonderful Saviour.\nBut we must beware. There is another sorrow which leads to death.\n Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 7:10 Worldly sorrow is what I experience out of a sense of entitlement, a sense of ‚Äúit\u0026rsquo;s not fair‚Äù, an inclination to blame God for all that\u0026rsquo;s wrong in my life.

This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\nWhere, then, is boasting? It is excluded.\n‚Äï Romans 3:21-22, 27 My response then to this gift of grace and righteousness must be to live a life of personal holiness. As I live my life, each day facing temptation, and each day surrendering my will to the sanctifying work of the Spirit, I articulate each small victory as an act of worship to my Heavenly Father who loves me and has rescued me from such.\n \u0026hellip; offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.\n‚Äï Romans 6:13-14 We should note that God\u0026rsquo;s call to personal holiness is not to the righteous but to sinners, and we would do well to remember his call to Abraham out of the absolute mess and shame that he found himself in thirteen long years after his shabby act with Hagar. Hear the grace and love in this, right alongside the uncompromising call to holiness. Our Heavenly Father has so much love and such a high expectation for his sons and daughters.\n When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.‚Äù\n‚Äï Genesis 17:1 Only in Christ can we live like this, but in him, we can!

There are however some that emphatically do not, for example ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb‚Äù and ‚ÄúHere I Bow‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe Who is Mighty‚Äù. I want to dwell in the latter today, because its bridge in particular is the epitome of true worship.\n Now my soul magnifies the Lord\nI rejoice in the God Who saves\nI will trust His unfailing love\nI will sing His praises all my days\n‚Äï Sovereign Grace Music, He Who Is Mighty Ironically there are three ‚ÄúI‚Äùs and two ‚Äúmy‚Äùs here, and yet this is in fact completely focused on the Lord. Singing this lifts me directly into his presence in joyous worship, losing myself in praise and awe and wonder‚∏∫this is the real thing! And the heart of it is ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù.\nThis is taken from Mary\u0026rsquo;s song of praise, the Magnificat, her response to her cousin Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s ‚ÄúBlessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!‚Äù after Mary\u0026rsquo;s humble acceptance of and joyful surrender to the Lord\u0026rsquo;s revelation to her (Luke 1:26-56).\nJust consider what Mary had gone through. The archangel had appeared to her and told her she was going to be the unmarried mother of the Son of God. On a human level, consider the shame she would face‚∏∫indeed, Joseph had in mind to break the marriage pledge quietly (Matthew 1:19). What was Mary\u0026rsquo;s response to the angel? That humble acceptance and joyful surrender:\n And Mary said, ‚ÄúBehold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 1:38 No wonder the angel had said to her, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.‚Äú (Luke 1:30).\nThe Greek word translated magnify is megalun≈ç, and is the same word translated shown in the following:\n Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbours and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.\n‚Äï Luke 1:57-58 The magnifying here is that of the Lord himself making known his great mercy‚∏∫the character and person of God being revealed and made known‚∏∫and the only right response is one of praise.\nSo what does it mean, ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù? Simply that all that is within me, the very core of my being, reveals and makes known and honours the character and person of God, and is aligned in love and praise and worship and affirmation that the Lord is great and so worthy of praise.

Too often we think in purely human terms, but there\u0026rsquo;s another dimension here.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s one side of the coin.\n For it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.\n‚Äï Philippians 2:13  For we are God‚Äôs handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:10 The Lord has plans and purposes, and he works in and through each one of us to fulfill them. He works even in the lives of those who neither honour nor acknowledge him. We know this. Now consider the other side of that coin.\nRecall that the Lord delights in exercising kindness (Jeremiah 9:24) ‚Äî this is one of his good purposes! So when we receive kindness from others, why would we not make that connection and ascribe it to him? To do so makes my soul sing in gratitude to my Saviour.\nRecently I experienced exactly this, twice.\nOn one occasion I was in church, after the morning service. Church can be the loneliest place, and I was facing the bleak prospect of a Sunday afternoon by myself, at a time when I was particularly downcast. Just outside church and completely out of the blue, a friend invited me mountain biking that afternoon, in a way that seemed so random and so kind.\nThe other was on my birthday, and I was at home in a melancholic mood. Suddenly there was a knock on my back door. It was my neighbour, with a slice of apple shortcake she had just made, and a little tub of cream to go with it. How lovely. She had no idea it was my birthday, nor did I tell her. How random again.\nI have learned that these random acts of kindness are not remotely random. I ascribe them to my Heavenly Father, and thank him. And through these he makes known his own character, his overflowing kindness, and he is glorified.\nPraise God‚Äôs name in song, Amy, and glorify him with thanksgiving! üôè\n","date":"2022-08-24T06:24:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/thankfulness-that-glorifies/joshua-clay-VNjNtdu0yCw-unsplash_huaba07fea2441414f7a99a1dd083c5641_966973_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/thankfulness-that-glorifies/","title":"Thankfulness that glorifies"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the last piece of the armour of God that is so often overlooked, indeed not even thought of as armour by many?\nUnderstanding the Bible is about reading in paragraphs, which are the basic units of expression, things that belong together. Not every Bible translation has the same paragraph breaks, but in both of my preferred translations‚Äîthe NIV 1984 and the ESV‚Äîthe armour of God is described in just one paragraph, which in the NIV ends with this.\n And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.\n‚Äï Ephesians 6:18 How interesting that Paul would conclude his writing about the armour of God with this. Let\u0026rsquo;s consider how praying in the Spirit could be considered a vital piece of the armour.\nFirstly, what does ‚Äúin the Spirit‚Äú even mean? There seems to be much confusion today about what is the work of the Holy Spirit. Jim Packer wrote a whole book about it, Keep in Step with the Spirit, in which he outlines some of the secondary aspects that seem to occupy most people\u0026rsquo;s attention, including power, revelation, and promptings, before arguing that the primary work of the Holy Spirit is to mediate the presence of Jesus in our lives. And indeed, this matches with what Jesus says of the Spirit in John 14.\nWhat Paul writes in Romans is closely related.\n In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.\n‚Äï Romans 8:26 Let\u0026rsquo;s not overthink this. Praying in the Spirit is simply praying in relationship with Jesus. There is no formula, just as there is no formula in human relationship. Mutual commitment and time spent together are required for the relationship to flourish. Jesus is committed! How he is that!! Are we?\nWe must do this on all occasions, and with all kinds of prayers and requests. Let\u0026rsquo;s not get into a rut of formulaic praying. Let\u0026rsquo;s sit with our wonderful Saviour and enjoy intimacy in relationship. In his presence we are protected in the spiritual battle.\nNotice too that Paul\u0026rsquo;s instruction is to pray for all the saints, that is, all Christians. In the spiritual battle we must avoid at all cost turning in on ourselves, as if we are the ones who matter most. By no means! Our brothers and sisters in Christ are the ones we must love, and continue to lift up before the Lord.\nPray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests, Amy, for all the saints! üôè\n","date":"2022-08-17T06:25:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/pray-in-the-spirit/manuel-meurisse-EuCll-F5atI-unsplash_hu6a84a878239a9639f67377d17e938f97_3429633_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/pray-in-the-spirit/","title":"Pray in the Spirit"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat are the two complementary ways to become an expert swordswoman?\n Take \u0026hellip; the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\n‚Äï Ephesians 6:17 For the first, Sunday school teachers have known since forever the value of memory verses for the spiritual battle. Jesus himself refuted Satan with such when tempted in the wilderness at the beginning of his ministry (Luke 4:1-13).\n ‚ÄòMan does not live on bread alone.‚Äô\n‚Äï Deuteronomy 8:3  ‚ÄòWorship the Lord your God and serve him only.‚Äô\n‚Äï Deuteronomy 6:13  ‚ÄòDo not put the Lord your God to the test.‚Äô\n‚Äï Deuteronomy 6:16 There is enormous power in such verses in the midst of the spiritual battle. Build up your arsenal, Amy, commit them to memory, and make them your own. Here\u0026rsquo;s just one of mine that I lean on when tempted to doubt and despair in the waiting time.\n You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the LORD your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed.\n‚Äï Joshua 23:14 But such verses are not enough. For the second then, we need understanding of the full breadth and depth of Scripture. We won\u0026rsquo;t get this from isolated verses. We get it from extensive reading and studying of the Bible. This is the only way to handle the word of God with integrity.\nThe greatest help I have found in this intimidating task is a book I bought while at university, shortly after becoming a Christian.\n Because the Bible is God\u0026rsquo;s Word, it has eternal relevance; it speaks to all mankind, in every age and in every culture. Because it is God\u0026rsquo;s Word, we must listen‚Äîand obey. But because God chose to speak His Word through human words in history, every book in the Bible also has historical particularity; each document is conditioned by the language, time, and culture in which it was originally written (and in some cases also by the oral history it had before it was written down). Interpretation of the Bible is demanded by the ‚Äútension‚Äù that exists between its eternal relevance and its historical particularity.\nA text cannot mean what it never meant. Or to put that in a positive way, the true meaning of the biblical text for us is what God originally intended it to mean when it was first spoken. This is the starting point. How we work it out from that point is what this book is basically all about.\n‚Äï Gordon D. Fee \u0026amp; Douglas Stuart, How¬†to¬†Read¬†the¬†Bible¬†for¬†All¬†Its¬†Worth, Chapter¬†1 Understanding the Bible in its entirety is surely the journey of a lifetime, but may it never become a dry and dusty chore, nor one that leads to intellectual vanity. Let us engage in this task with all of our mind and a surrendered will, joyfully anticipating new depths of insight into the Father\u0026rsquo;s holiness, majesty, love and faithfulness, and into the magnitude of our rescue by our wonderful Saviour. A right response to our increasing knowledge and understanding will be holy reverence, awe and wonder, gratitude, and adoration and worship of our Lord and Saviour.\nImmerse yourself joyfully in the written word of God, Amy, and learn to wield the sword of the Spirit with integrity and understanding! üôè\n","date":"2022-08-10T06:25:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-sword-of-the-spirit/totte-annerbrink-7PRi1chCnrs-unsplash_hu3fdd798d4ac005977ee813f02447138f_766591_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-sword-of-the-spirit/","title":"The sword of the Spirit"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow is the helmet of salvation a misnomer?\n Put on the full armour of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.\nTake the helmet of salvation \u0026hellip;\n‚Äï Ephesians 6:13, 17a What actually is this helmet of salvation that Paul tells us to put on? It can\u0026rsquo;t be salvation per se, as that is a gift of and from the Lord, received through faith. What is it then that we should put on, and continue to put on?\nThe answer is found in a similar exhortation Paul writes to the Thessalonians.\n But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.\n‚Äï 1 Thessalonians 5:8 So it\u0026rsquo;s all about hope ‚Äî the hope of salvation. Recall what hope is. It\u0026rsquo;s not some finger-crossing wishful thinking. By no means! It is grounds for believing that something good will happen, with certainty. And in this case that is something overwhelmingly wonderfully bountifully joyously good, something worth truly waiting for.\nBut in the case of salvation, what is there still to hope for? Don\u0026rsquo;t we already have it? The simple truth is this: our salvation is already accomplished, but not yet complete. One day it will be so and the battle will be over. That is a certainty, and until then this hope is stored up for us in heaven (Colossians 1:5-6).\nIn the meantime, the process by which we receive this salvation is ongoing and joyous.\n Though you have not seen [Jesus], you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.\n‚Äï 1 Peter 1:8-9 Note the present continuous tense here. We are receiving the goal of our faith, which is our salvation. The process is ongoing and will last for all of our earthly lives, but it will eventually come to an end, as recounted in John\u0026rsquo;s vision of the end of days.\n Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: ‚ÄúNow have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ.

Jesus says of the devil,\n ‚ÄúWhen he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:44b But lies can be insidious. They must be stamped out before they take hold, like flames licking around. What do these lies do? They create doubt. And how do we combat doubt? By exercising and building faith! But how do we do this?\nWhat is faith anyway? Those who think it is an intellectual acceptance of some revealed truth are so far away from real understanding. Faith is a life lived upon the foundation of this truth from the Lord, upon Christ himself, fully committed, trusting and even depending on him to keep his promises. (And he will.) So, how to do this?\nRuthless consistency is again the key. I have to ask myself with brutal honesty, does my life reflect that I will one day stand before the Lord and give an account? Does my life reflect that I have understood Jesus teaching and am living by it in full obedience to him, joyously surrendered? Many seem not to understand this and then wonder why their faith is so small and why doubt is creeping in. Half-hearted belief is no belief at all.\nConsider even this one thing that Jesus said.\n But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.\n‚Äï Matthew 19:30 The context of this is the rich young ruler, earnestly seeking but tragically unable to give up this life\u0026rsquo;s riches and pleasures for the Kingdom, just like so many today. Why is it that even within the church so many are trying to be first?

But what is the nature of this righteousness without which we cannot live before the Lord? It is interesting to see how writers disagree about this, because there are two possible answers.\n In the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last.\n‚Äï Romans 1:17  This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\n‚Äï Romans 3:22 The first view is that the breastplate is Christ\u0026rsquo;s righteousness imputed to us, a free gift of grace received entirely through faith. We can stand firm irrespective of our own wretchedness and sin and failure because of this righteousness from God.\nThere is profound truth in this. But there is another view.\n But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted. You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.\n‚Äï Romans 6:17-18 Jesus said,\n ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, whoever keeps my word will never see death.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 8:51 Being slaves to righteousness and living in total surrender and complete obedience to God is about our sanctification, and ultimately our works, as we are transformed into the likeness of Christ and live lives that reflect that. Faith or works? Are these contradictory? Jim Packer has a helpful explanation.\n Final judgment, as we saw, will be according to our works‚Äîthat is, our doings, our whole course of life. The relevance of our \u0026lsquo;doings\u0026rsquo; is not that they ever merit an award from the court‚Äîthey are too far short of perfection to do that‚Äîbut that they provide an index of what is in the heart.\nIt is not that one way of acting was meritorious while the other was not, but that from these actions one can tell whether there was love to Christ, the love that springs from faith, in the heart.\n‚Äï J. I. Packer, Knowing God, Chapter 14 James takes up this very idea.\n Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.\n‚Äï James 2:18 And now we can see it clearly. The righteousness is Christ\u0026rsquo;s alone, freely given and received through faith by us who believe, and initiating in us an ongoing transformation into slaves to righteousness. Through this we live ever more radically changed lives, and through this we have assurance of salvation. The merit is all Christ\u0026rsquo;s and so is the glory.

The leather straps (baltea) dangling from the front of the belt with their decorative studs (bullae) were the only insignia on their uniform. The belt was about identity.\nAnd so it is with the belt of truth.

Only by holding onto this are we able to stand firm in the spiritual battle.\n Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he or she is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 5:17 Stand firm in this truth, Amy, which is your identity in Christ! üôè\n","date":"2022-07-06T06:24:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-belt-of-truth/Roman_cingulum_1_hu68cb47ef129d42652b1360f6ab60930e_166174_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-belt-of-truth/","title":"The belt of truth"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is even harder than forgiving those whose sin against us is breathtakingly heinous? Here\u0026rsquo;s what: forgiving ourselves.\nIt could be said that part of growing up is having to learn to live with the consequences of one\u0026rsquo;s own mistakes, consequences which can be far-reaching indeed. But learning to live with and forgiving are quite different.\nMistakes and wilful sins are also quite different. But when all the confessing and repenting is done, the endpoint may be the same: agonizing regret over the life that has been lost, what was and is no longer, or what was once hoped for but never came to be.\nLet us remind ourselves why Jesus came.\n I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\n‚Äï John 10:10b But how can those grieving over such a loss experience this?\nFirstly we must repudiate any suggestion that the rescued life is in any sense second class.\n Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who then is the one who condemns?\n‚Äï Romans 8:33-34a Me? Is it me that condemns? Is it me that contradicts the Lord of all creation over his declaration of my righteousness in Christ? What am I thinking? Who am I to think that my own judgment is the one that matters?\nAnd secondly there is this.\n This is what the LORD says \u0026hellip;\n‚ÄúForget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.‚Äù\n‚Äï Isaiah 43:16, 18-19 In the wasteland which is my life, the Lord is doing a new thing, which is springing up, even now. Streams of living water. A way in the desert.\nLonging for what is past is incongruous. The lesson of history is that the Lord does not go back. What is lost is ultimately no loss. It has become a shrivelled, dead thing. There is a new thing springing up which is alive and exciting. Joseph experienced this. Job experienced it, finally ‚Äî the goodness and kindness and overflowing generosity of the Lord, who does not disappoint.\nAnd so, this is how I can forgive myself and let go of the past. I surrender, Lord, not only to your plans and purposes for my life, but to your declaration that I am a new creation in Christ.

This is not optional, it is commanded by Jesus.\n ‚ÄúIf your brother or sister sins, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying \u0026lsquo;I repent\u0026rsquo;, you must forgive them.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 17:3-4 I am facing a situation in which this is a real challenge. The response I received to my articulated desire for reconciliation and relationship and mutual forgiveness and healing was a crushing and callous brush-off. What now?\nMy first attempt to forgive was a false start. I tried to diminish the magnitude of the offence, to find a way to receive it as a simple misunderstanding, to excuse the other\u0026rsquo;s behaviour. This failed because there was no truth in it. The behaviour was in fact wretched and reprehensible. I cannot deny it.\nI then had to grapple with ‚Äúif they repent‚Äù. In my situation, there is no repentance. There is stubborn and Pharisaical judgment and rejection, and refusal to engage in authentic relationship. It is crushing. Heartbreaking.\nSome writers have tried to argue that the requirement to forgive is conditional on repentance, and in this passage it indeed appears so. Is that the whole story though? I think not. But let\u0026rsquo;s not resort to a human argument.\nConsider this from the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer, and what Jesus said next in the Sermon on the Mount:\n And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.\nFor if you forgive others when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\n‚Äï Matthew 6:12, 14-15 Here our forgiveness of others is linked to God\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness of us no less. How vital then is it to forgive!\nAnd what of this?\n When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals‚Äîone on his right, the other on his left. Jesus said, ‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.‚Äù\n‚Äï Luke 23:33-34a Was there repentance here? Of course not! How are we called to live? Like Christ! And how can we find the power to do this? Only in him!\nTo do this I must die to self, again. But as I do, I find I am being transformed into Christ\u0026rsquo;s likeness. There is no greater joy, even in the midst of all this pain. The joy in that transformation is empowering indeed!\nThis is a lengthy process, an ongoing journey, and I am not yet done. May the Lord have mercy on that individual as I forgive, and continue to forgive, dying to self and becoming like Christ. And if they come to the point of repentance, may we be restored in authentic relationship again, by Christ\u0026rsquo;s power and for his glory.\nLive like Christ, Amy, in him and by his power and for his glory, fuelled by the joy in your own transformation! üôè\n","date":"2022-06-22T08:00:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/forgiving-others/madhu-shesharam-KQZZCVyEWVk-unsplash_hu8642bb43102fde55e6de8f6d3ce95497_1638295_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/forgiving-others/","title":"Forgiving others"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHave you ever chosen to take the opposite view than the one you would naturally hold, and found insight?

Fear no evil, there is no need. Consider who is this one who is with you. He prepares a table before you in the presence of your enemies. They are nothing to him.

In the context of my ongoing waiting on an impossible promise from the Lord, he cannot relate to someone who he would say is living in the hope of something that contradicts the observed and obvious reality. He asks, how could I have abandoned reason and switched off the rational part of my brain in quite such a naive way?\nI argue that in fact the opposite is true, and that I have brought all my intellect and understanding to bear in my faith situation. How so? And what does the Bible have to say about this?\n The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.\n‚Äï Proverbs 9:10 One aspect of wisdom is applied intellect, that is intellect used to align a life with knowledge of the Holy One in a practical way, in order to live that life on the right path. And wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord. Recall Tim Keller\u0026rsquo;s definition: ‚ÄúThe fear of the Lord is a reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done.‚Äù\nIf the Lord of all creation loves me to the extent that he gave up his only Son to an excruciating death in order to rescue me, and has promised abundant life and ongoing rescue in him, the only rational response is to completely cast myself upon his love, trusting him, absolutely. Anything less betrays a lack of understanding of the eternal reality. (Sadly it seems to me that few indeed are able to rationalize to this extent.)\nWhat does this rational response look like then? Here\u0026rsquo;s what. Diving headfirst into the wellspring of life. Living confidently on the firm foundation of such a promise from the Lord. Ruthless consistency is the key which unlocks the understanding to be able to live like this.\nAnd so radical faith in the one who is faithful and true is in fact the only way to live with intellectual integrity.

Paul tells us.\n Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.\n‚Äï 2 Corinthians 1:3-4 I gained some insight into this recently, quite indirectly and unexpectedly. Just as I was arriving back home from a run, I bumped into a friend, a professor of theology with whom I have had some interesting and uplifting conversations over the years. I remarked that I had been struck by the incredible grace and kindness of the Lord. He then asked an interesting question: ‚ÄúDid something particularly good just happen?‚Äù to which the answer was no, not at all.\nAs I reflected on this later, it made me a little sad. So often, the grace of God is understood as being received through our circumstances, equated with something good and pleasant happening to us. How impoverished can be our understanding of grace! The grace of God is a powerful, tangible thing, which can be received and experienced in its own right, independently of any change in circumstance. And invisible to others, save perhaps for some glow about us as we receive it.\nAnd so it is with comfort.

In particular, note this.\n For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.\n‚Äï v5 Suffering and comfort here are hand-in-hand.

As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axe-head fell into the water. ‚ÄúOh, my lord,‚Äù he cried out, ‚Äúit was borrowed!‚Äù\nThe man of God asked, ‚ÄúWhere did it fall?‚Äù When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float. ‚ÄúLift it out,‚Äù he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.\n‚Äï 2 Kings 6:4-7 What a curious little account. How are we to understand it? Firstly, let\u0026rsquo;s note just what a man of God Elisha was. When Elijah was handing down to him the mantle of being the Lord\u0026rsquo;s prophet, Elisha asked to inherit a double portion of his spirit. (How cheeky was that? ‚Äî 2 Kings 2:1-15) He certainly received it!\nBack to the axe-head then. Losing an axe-head would have been no small matter‚Äîthere was certainly no Mitre 10 Mega to provide a replacement. And consider the shame of losing borrowed equipment, especially something so valuable. But still, surely a trivial thing in the light of eternity? Why would the Lord even care? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t he be more concerned with the learning and growth opportunity afforded by suffering such a loss? Isn\u0026rsquo;t this life supposed to be about learning to suffer and submit to such? How easily we could fail to understand the Father-heart of God!\nWhat do we actually see revealed here then? Here\u0026rsquo;s what. A lavish, gratuitously kind and compassionate miraculous response to a material loss. Yes, the man had been careless, and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have let this happen. But it did, and the Lord stepped in with no rebuke, demonstrating through his servant Elisha such affection and concern for one he loved.\nAnd so it is with us. The Lord\u0026rsquo;s kindness and compassion for us is rooted in the reality of our situation. How ready he is to step in and rescue! He understands us, he understands our need, and his response is love and kindness.\nRun to your Heavenly Father, Amy, with any and all of your needs, because he cares for you! üôè\n","date":"2022-05-04T06:24:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/an-axe-head-floats/hendrik-cornelissen-x59BNivBcQ8-unsplash_hua0b8385eb1161c61c029d6f17371114e_3860348_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/an-axe-head-floats/","title":"An axe-head floats"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat if I told you there was a way to get exactly what you want?

As you know, I like to ask the big questions, so let\u0026rsquo;s start with that! In fact, Megan and I are in Glenorchy, just about to embark on the Rees-Dart track, so we\u0026rsquo;ll be out of coverage for the next four days, and that\u0026rsquo;s the reason. With that out of the way, let\u0026rsquo;s move on to the next big question. üòÅ\nWhat was the first Easter victory, and how did that lead to the second?\nTwo victories? Yes, really! The first victory was won on the cross, as Jesus died.\n Jesus said, ‚ÄúIt is finished.‚Äù With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.\n‚Äï John 19:30 Finished here means completed, fulfilled, accomplished. A triumphant, ‚ÄúI have done it!‚Äù This is the first victory, won at inconceivable cost, to the Son and the Father both. It is victory over sin, in our lives.\nHow did this lead to the second? Paul explains exactly how.\n Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:\nWho, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death‚Äîeven death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\n‚Äï Philippians 2:5-11 The how is in the therefore. Jesus made himself obedient even to death on a cross, and therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name. This is the second victory, resurrection victory over death itself, in his life and ours both.\nJust how exalted is Jesus? Every knee should bow, and every tongue confess. Here\u0026rsquo;s John\u0026rsquo;s vision of the end of time:\n Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: ‚ÄúTo him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever!‚Äù\nThe four living creatures said, ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù, and the elders fell down and worshipped.\n‚Äï Revelation 5:13-14 Fall down with them, Amy, and worship the one who is worthy to receive praise and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever! üôèüôå\n","date":"2022-04-19T09:11:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/two-victories/jordan-wozniak-xP_AGmeEa6s-unsplash_hu90d7b379905df321a5a17b1bf0e1d1c4_3817667_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/two-victories/","title":"Two victories"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the turning point in the Easter story?\nIn fact there are two. We\u0026rsquo;ll come to the joyous second, but let\u0026rsquo;s not rush that. Now is the time to contemplate the mournful first.\nI have been reading Mark\u0026rsquo;s account of the last days of Jesus\u0026rsquo; life, from the triumphal entry into Jerusalem up until his death on the cross (Mark 11-15). There\u0026rsquo;s much that happens, starting with Jesus clearing the temple, which had become a den of robbers. We see Jesus speaking and acting with power and authority. Until we don\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe turning point is signalled when Jesus is before the high priest, being interrogated. Being accused.\n But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.\n‚Äï Mark 14:61 Haven\u0026rsquo;t you wondered about that? In fact Mark records here only one statement from Jesus.\n Again the high priest asked him, ‚ÄúAre you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI am,‚Äù said Jesus. ‚ÄúAnd you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 14:61-62 Mark records Jesus speaking only once more, confirming Pilate\u0026rsquo;s description of him, in his words as the king of the Jews. And after this, nothing.\nAnd this is the turning point, over which I have been weeping. After confirming that he is indeed the Lord of all creation, from here on Jesus is no longer the one who does anything at all. Having given up all the power and authority which are his by right, he is now simply one who is done to. He makes himself nothing but the object of others\u0026rsquo; actions, completely and absolutely surrendered to their will, to the Father\u0026rsquo;s will, like a lamb to the slaughter. And we read a factual, brutal account of what was done to him, culminating in this.\n They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means ‚Äúthe place of the skull‚Äù).\nAnd they crucified him.\n‚Äï Mark 15:22, 24 The Lord of all creation, humiliated. Pierced. Crushed. Extinguished. The object of God\u0026rsquo;s wrath. But let us be clear about what was happening. Just before he died, Jesus cried out in anguish:\n ‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù\n‚Äï Mark 15:34 I know the answer to this. You know the answer.\nMarvel, Amy, even in the weeping, at that answer which is the Father\u0026rsquo;s great love for you! üôè\n","date":"2022-04-13T06:25:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/sacrifice/Crucifixus_hu3ce5f6eb50f9e2c658a05f8144fca13d_61715_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/sacrifice/","title":"Sacrifice"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we be completely confident in surrendering to the Lord\u0026rsquo;s will?

If I invite the Spirit into my situation, into my life, how can I be sure he will do what I am hoping for?

Last week we came upon just such a realisation. I can\u0026rsquo;t do better than to share the extract which had this effect on me.\n If a father continues cheerful and carefree while his son is getting into trouble, or if a husband remains unmoved when his wife is in distress, we wonder at once how much love there can be in their relationship, for we know that those who truly love are only happy when those whom they love are truly happy also. So it is with God in his love for us.\n‚Äï J. I. Packer, Knowing God, Chapter 12, The Love of God Already this is giving us an inkling that there could be something truly profound about the nature of God\u0026rsquo;s love that we may have overlooked. Packer continues.\n Through setting his love on human beings God has voluntarily bound up his own final happiness with theirs.\n‚Äï J. I. Packer Oh my! Could he really have done this? I am mind-blown already.\n He has set his love upon particular sinners, and this means that, by his own free voluntary choice, he will not know perfect and unmixed happiness again till he has brought every one of them to heaven. He has in effect resolved that henceforth for all eternity his happiness shall be conditional upon ours.\n‚Äï J. I. Packer It is almost beyond comprehension that the Lord would do this. How much pain, searing, lasting pain, has he taken upon himself in this decision? How much of his joy is now tied up in ours? What kind of love is this? What kind of God is this?\n Thus God saves, not only for his glory, but also for his gladness. This goes far to explain why it is that there is joy (God\u0026rsquo;s own joy) in the presence of the angels when a sinner repents (Luke 15:10), and why there will be exceeding joy when God sets us faultless at the last day in his own holy presence (Jude 24). The thought passes understanding and almost beggars belief, but there is no doubt that according to Scripture, such is the love of God.\n‚Äï J. I. Packer Consider what it means that the Lord has set his love on you, Amy, and may it blow your mind! üôè\n","date":"2022-03-30T06:27:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-love-of-god/theo-eilertsen-photography-mwlhFUCir_8-unsplash_hu144789d197b7a2cdd1d3fa5901463ac7_1424235_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-love-of-god/","title":"The love of God"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat does perfect timing look like?\nSome think it looks like that scene at Helm\u0026rsquo;s Deep, where Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli with some of the Rohirrim defend against an overwhelming army of orcs. They are expecting Gandalf to show up with the Riders of Rohan, but for so long he doesn\u0026rsquo;t come. After the longest time, when it looks like all may be lost, finally he arrives, riding Shadowfax and wielding his staff with great power against the evil hordes. Victory is won and the friends are reunited.\nBut what if that doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen? Consider this.\n Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.\nSo the sisters sent word to Jesus, ‚ÄúLord, the one you love is sick.‚Äù\nWhen he heard that Lazarus was sick, Jesus stayed where he was two more days.\nOn his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.\n‚ÄúLord,‚Äù Martha said to Jesus, ‚Äúif you had been here, my brother would not have died.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 11:1,¬†3,¬†6,¬†17,¬†21 Imagine for a moment you don\u0026rsquo;t know what happens next ‚Äî in our own lives that is certainly the case.

Jesus wept with the sisters, joining with them in their grief and their pain. So much pain. How he shared in their grief. His tears were real, because the pain was real, even knowing what he was about to do. And then he raised Lazarus to life! Hallelujah! What a saviour!

He earnestly sought the Lord and wrote many of the psalms which have blessed the generations. But let us not make the mistake of thinking that he was a righteous man. His later life was in fact a catalogue of failure and shame, culminating in his most shabby and shameful moral failure, committing adultery with Bathsheba and murdering her husband Uriah the Hittite (2¬†Samuel¬†11).\nPreviously, David wrote Psalm 3 when he was being pursued by his son Absalom, who was trying to kill him and seize control of the kingdom. What greater failure as a father could there be than that? How utterly shameful.\nAnd yet we read this.\n But you, LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high.\n‚Äï Psalm 3:3 David was so aware that he had no glory of his own. He had only shame. But the Lord himself was his glory, and not only the reason that he could hold his head high, but the one who actually lifted his head.\n(Of course, this in no way diminishes the Lord\u0026rsquo;s condemnation of sin in one\u0026rsquo;s life. David was severely rebuked by the Lord after his wretched doings with Bathsheba. Repentance was very necessary. Forgiveness followed.)\nAnd so it is for us.

But here\u0026rsquo;s a reflection on this, somewhat of an excursion into make-believe, which nevertheless may help to shed some light.\nFirstly, note that we are encouraged, nay commanded to pray, and to pray boldly.\n Pray continually\n‚Äï 1 Thessalonians 5:17  ‚ÄúIf you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 21:22  ‚ÄúYou may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 14:14 Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine then.

It is a glorious, majestic work featuring players both unwilling and willing, with plunging depths and soaring heights, human folly and heavenly beneficence, sorrow and joy. It is a love story, the greatest of them all, a story of rescue and redemption of a wayward people, pieced together from fragments of ruined lives made whole.\nAs the billions of orchestral members play their parts with quite some improvising, the Lord hears the prayers of the saints, our prayers, and delights to weave them in to the score, making amendments and annotations with his divine pencil even as the music unfolds, taking our imperfect petitions and making them part of his perfect plans and purposes, as it pleases him. And with each, smiling down on his beloved ones with such affection, like a proud father. Smiling on us, who are contributing somehow to his glorious work.\nMarvel at the mystery of his ways, Amy, praising the Lord for his majesty, grace and kindness, and continue praying Kingdom prayers! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"2022-03-09T06:31:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-symphony-of-life/jack-finnigan-aEkk0KxvPpg-unsplash_huc428196cf8da404bd48f1e11e5ff3aaa_4080035_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-symphony-of-life/","title":"The Symphony of Life"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the world\u0026rsquo;s favourite pastime?\nWhat is it that people love to do? That the whole media machine is geared up to deliver? At which society has become so very accomplished? Here\u0026rsquo;s what: taking offence.\nTaking offence ‚Äî human nature delights in it, Christians too at times, sadly. We love to be outraged. It is almost tribal. People bond over it, which means that people also divide over it, for there is always a source of the offence, and that source is surely a person.\nSatan has a field day with this ‚Äî oh how he uses it! What is to be done? Two things.\n Recognize it for what it is. Offence-taking is not of the Lord.

Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.\n‚Äï Ephesians 4:1-3 Bearing with one another in love is the key. This is the opposite of offence-taking. What does it look like, this bearing with one another, in love?\nTo bear with someone means to be patient, to be tolerant. We are all imperfect, and sometimes we say things that could be misconstrued. Let us receive one another with humility, gentleness and patience, bearing with one another in love. May generous hearts enable us to navigate with wisdom and kindness those pinch points at which offence could so easily be taken. The Lord is glorified as we do, for it is in his Spirit that we are able to do this. Bearing with one another in love is powerfully and relationally healing.\nLive like this, Amy, and know the joy of the Lord in keeping the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace! üôè\n","date":"2022-03-02T06:25:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/taking-offence/martin-olsen-szfPB4X-FWk-unsplash_huac110bd7af19d433ae3d095da2651a8e_8003080_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/taking-offence/","title":"Taking offence"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow is this life like Scooby-Doo?\nEvery Scooby-Doo episode I can remember ends in the same way.

How often life can seem so adversarial, with obstacles being put in our way by people who are frankly, just so annoying!

What exactly should I do then? Er \u0026hellip; live honourably, behave well, be kind to strangers, help old ladies across the street? Is this what Paul means? Notice how we bring so much of our own context to understanding a verse. The only way to know is to read the verse in its context. So what is the context here?\n As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.\n‚Äï Ephesians 4:1-3 This is the immediate context. The wider context is the whole letter. Paul was writing this letter from Rome, where he was confined ‚Äúfor the Lord‚Äù (Acts 28). Notice what he went through in serving the one he loved, and how much humility he demonstrated, giving up his very freedom for the sake of the ones for whom he was sent.\nReading on, we can understand what his urging means, what is this worthy life to be lived. It is a life of humility, a life to be lived in community with others. None of these attributes can be outworked on our own: humility, gentleness, bearing with one another in love, keeping unity. And note that Paul was able to write with such credibility (‚Äúthen‚Äù) because of the testimony of his own life, his own humility.\nThe word worthy here means appropriate. So they, and we, are urged to live a life appropriate to the calling we have received. What is this calling, this invitation? And why is a life of humility the appropriate response?\n For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚Äîand this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚Äînot by works, so that no-one can boast.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:8-9 Each of us has been rescued by grace alone, with no merit on our part. The rescue was undeserved and there is no room for boasting.\n(Later in the chapter, Paul goes on to other aspects of living a worthy life. Humility by itself is not enough, of course. But that is a subject for another day.)\nLive a life worthy of the calling you have received, Amy, now you know where that begins! üôè\n","date":"2022-02-16T06:25:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/a-life-worthy-of-our-calling/vidar-nordli-mathisen-K4c8RymNeu8-unsplash_hu07a1bfd2d8cccefec9d29ee1d2ccba00_741808_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/a-life-worthy-of-our-calling/","title":"A life worthy of our calling"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we receive it when God speaks the impossible?\nWe have many examples of God speaking something impossible.

Joshua had to act on the basis that something impossible would happen. (And it did.)\nArguably Abraham had it even harder. He had to wait on an impossible promise, for twenty-five years! Waiting is perhaps harder than doing. And waiting for twenty-five years?!\nThere are other examples in the Bible of God speaking the impossible.

It means that their experience was substantially like our own.\nWe must pray for the faith and for the experiences that would enable us to believe that such things could happen to us. Only then will we be able to recognize, accept and dwell in them when they come.\n‚Äï Dallas Willard, Hearing God, Chapter 2 How then can we receive it when God speaks the impossible? It is in fact a high honour, an invitation to demonstrate radical faith, and to grow in that faith. Perhaps God reserves such things for those for whom he has great plans, which will require great faith. (That\u0026rsquo;s a little scary, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?) No-one starts with such faith, but the Lord in his wisdom knows what he is doing. Again, consider Abraham.\nAnd so I hold on to this verse, which has kept me going for some years, and was itself given to me in a miraculous way.\n God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind.

Does he promise and not fulfill?\n‚Äï Numbers 23:19 This remains even if the promise is impossible.\n Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: ‚ÄúI am the LORD, the God of all mankind.

And yet, why is it that we do not live like this? For tragically, we do not. We should be living and breathing this, all the time. Nothing matters more. But what exactly are we supposed to do as we go about our lives?\nA phrase I came upon recently has really got its hooks into me: relational authenticity. This is surely the starting point. Relational authenticity recognises that the one standing before me is a real person, whoever they may be. A real person with their hopes, dreams, disappointments and hurts, just like me. And the choice which is uniquely mine is whether and how to relate, to accept, to love. How do I regard them? As background noise? A diversion? A duty? Someone to look down upon? Someone to avoid? Or a whole person, with all their value and complexity and brokenness, loved by the Lord, as am I?\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more. Relational authenticity demands radical humility.\n There is no difference \u0026hellip; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.\n‚Äï Romans 3:22-24 How this challenges ego! But could we live like this? The prize is glorious!\n In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.\n‚Äï Ephesians 2:21-22 As we develop relational authenticity, this is what we will find: all of us, together, a holy temple in the Lord!\nLet us not overlook that this is the fruit of the Spirit. We grow in this as the Lord does his work of transforming grace in our lives. In my life. In yours.

There are two vital destinations that can help us grow in self-control, especially in the face of temptation. But first, take note of this.\n God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.\n‚Äï 1 Corinthians 10:13 We should expect to be tempted. How else will we grow in self-control other than by exercising it? So we should expect also to have to work at this. It won\u0026rsquo;t be easy, obviously, since nothing worthwhile was ever gained like that. Just let us never overlook God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness in enabling us to stand.\nOur first destination in time is just a few minutes into the future. Let us imagine looking back, observing our own behaviour through the lens of hindsight. Do we see someone behaving honourably? Someone displaying strength of character? Someone we are pleased to be? May the Lord\u0026rsquo;s sustaining grace enable us to be that! We must be mindful that our character is defined by the accumulation of every choice that we make, no matter how small or apparently insignificant. The new viewpoint helps enormously with this!\nOur second destination is a little further, at the end of our lives. Let us imagine being welcomed into heaven by our Lord. What is it that I want to hear on that day? I will live my life to hear him say this.\n ‚ÄúWell done, good and faithful servant!‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 25:23 Do some time-travelling in your mind, Amy, and live your life to hear him say, ‚ÄúWell done, my good and faithful servant!‚Äù üôè\n","date":"2022-01-12T06:30:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/self-control/peter-herrmann-9_FK2Tp-kLA-unsplash_hu69269329ef5205aa1d81b50dbc9e9331_3329658_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/self-control/","title":"Self-control"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat fuels faithfulness?\n The fruit of the Spirit is \u0026hellip; faithfulness\n‚Äï Galatians 5:22 Faithfulness is such an honourable character trait, perhaps the noblest of them all. To be loyal, steadfast, trustworthy and true ‚Äî surely these words make our hearts soar. They speak to the very heart of noble character, of character that honours the Lord. So where does faithfulness come from? There are two answers to this.\nFirstly, the Lord\u0026rsquo;s own faithfulness, evident throughout Scripture, from where he first introduces himself to Moses, right up to John\u0026rsquo;s vision on the island of Patmos of the risen Lord Jesus, the rider on the white horse.\n And [the LORD] passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin.\n‚Äï Exodus 34:6-7  All the ways of the LORD are loving and faithful for those who keep the demands of his covenant.\n‚Äï Psalm 25:10  For the word of the LORD is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.\n‚Äï Psalm 33:4  Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.\n‚Äï Psalm 36:5  Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope: Because of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.\n‚Äï Lamentations 3:21-23  The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.\n‚Äï 1 Thessalonians 5:24  Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.\n‚Äï Hebrews 10:23  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\n‚Äï 1 John 1:9  I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True.\n‚Äï Revelation 19:11 The Lord\u0026rsquo;s own faithfulness to us makes our hearts burn with fire, fuelling our own faithfulness, our noblest thoughts and deeds, through and for him.\nSecondly, consider the word itself, pistis in the original Greek. Mostly that word is not in fact translated as faithfulness, but rather faith.\n Pistis ‚Äî persuasion that is credence; moral conviction (of religious truth or the truthfulness of God or a religious teacher) especially reliance upon Christ for salvation; abstractly constancy in such profession; by extension the system of religious (Gospel) truth.\n‚Äï Strong\u0026#39;s Greek Lexicon Faithfulness then is fueled by being full of faith. Genuine, all-in, life-changing faith in the one who is faithful to all he has said, and indeed all he is, gives us the power to live lives that are worthy of our calling, manifesting in the noblest of hearts, and lasting faithfulness.\nLook to him Amy, whose name is Faithful and True, be full of faith, and let that fuel your own faithfulness, to him and for him, forever! üôè\n","date":"2022-01-05T08:00:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/faithfulness/sean-benesh-VnmbcgAfL3Q-unsplash_hu4c9e3431344ffbd35878d4c1321f632c_3305487_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/faithfulness/","title":"Faithfulness"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we choose joy?\n The fruit of the Spirit is \u0026hellip; joy\n‚Äï Galatians 5:22 Isn\u0026rsquo;t joy something that from time to time lands on us, thrills our heart, and lifts us into the Lord\u0026rsquo;s presence? How can we choose this for ourselves? In fact we can, and understanding this is the key to a deeper, richer, more joyous walk with the Lord, independent of the circumstances of our lives.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a clue in Paul\u0026rsquo;s command (a command, no less!) to the Philippians.\n Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!\n‚Äï Philippians 4:4 He says it again because it is of such great importance. We must understand this!

There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.‚Äù\n‚ÄúDoes Job fear God for nothing?‚Äù Satan replied. ‚ÄúHave you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.‚Äù\n‚Äï Job 1:8-11 The apostle Peter takes this principle and expands upon it.\n For a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that your faith \u0026hellip; may be proved genuine\n‚Äï 1 Peter 1:6-7 If we truly grasp this, it empowers us to respond with patience in affliction. How else can I show the Lord that my love for him is real and not merely cupboard love, that my trust is absolute, and my faith genuine? I rejoice when I find that I can do these things! And I am mindful that this is a heart-work of the Holy Spirit.

So, how can we grow in patience in the face of delay?\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m asking an easy question! We grow in this patience by having to wait, and by learning to wait well. But actually waiting well is anything but easy. It is the hardest thing. And it\u0026rsquo;s harder still when we can\u0026rsquo;t understand why. Why the wait?\nIt helps to consider those who waited before us. Like Moses.\nAfter a miraculous escape from being drowned at birth, Moses had a privileged upbringing, growing up in the royal palace of Egypt, learning leadership and what it meant to rule. As a gifted and highly capable forty year old, he thought he was ready to lead his people out of slavery. The Lord had other plans! Moses spent the next forty years tending sheep in the wilderness. We can wonder how long it took him to come to terms with that! I\u0026rsquo;m sure he spent quite some time raging against the apparent pointlessness of his life. But what was the result?\n Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.\n‚Äï Numbers 12:3 During those forty years the Lord wrought some fundamental changes in Moses\u0026rsquo; heart. Where else did that humility come from? In that waiting time, Moses had been completely transformed, and was finally ready to be used by the Lord.\nWaiting may feel like death, but in fact it can be a path to abundant life, to the mother lode of spiritual blessing and joy. It is a powerful agency of the Lord to change our heart and grow each one of us into someone who can be of some use in the Kingdom. If we can notice this happening in ourselves as it unfolds, that may help us to wait with patience, and to wait well.\nLearn to wait well, Amy, and grow in patience! üôè\n","date":"2021-11-24T06:25:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/patience-in-waiting/pavlenko-8BNO4HUQYRw-unsplash_hu5fc3c5de92255b47bde5d6171aec2a54_1378295_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/patience-in-waiting/","title":"Patience in waiting"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat is the most Christlike response we can give to an angry, frustrated, hostile, hurting world?\n The fruit of the Spirit is \u0026hellip; gentleness\n‚Äï Galatians 5:22-23 The first thing to note about the fruit of the Spirit is that there is only one fruit (‚Äúthe fruit of the Spirit is \u0026hellip;‚Äù), and that fruit has nine characteristics.

What would we write to such a one? If we\u0026rsquo;re honest, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it seem a little surprising to see gentleness in that list of other more obvious qualities?

The Lord is near.\n‚Äï Philippians 4:4-5 The Lord is near, and what is the thing that really matters (besides rejoicing)? Our gentleness. We see this in Jesus himself. How prominently is his gentleness described, both in prophecy, and by and of himself.\n Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\n‚Äï Zechariah 9:9  A bruised reed he will not break, and a smouldering wick he will not snuff out.\n‚Äï Isaiah 42:3  ‚ÄúCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

Notice this: ‚ÄúBecause she loves me,‚Äù says the LORD, ‚ÄúI will rescue her‚Äù. This is someone who is already in relationship.

The Lord is good (because he is). That\u0026rsquo;s a true statement, but it\u0026rsquo;s not what he wrote. What he wrote, rather, is something we are commanded to do. Taste! And see! Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this.\nTasting is an action. There is something to do. Physically, we put food in our mouths and chew on it. As an aside, how gracious of the Lord to make this a pleasurable experience. We are really just refueling our bodies. Who else would have decided to make that something to enjoy? The Lord\u0026rsquo;s character is revealed even in this, that he found yet another way to bless us, his beloved. Praise him!\nThis gives us some insight. We experience the goodness of God as a result of taking some action. What action is that?\nIt seems to me that more than any other the word that appears alongside the goodness of God throughout scripture is trust, that those who would see his goodness must trust, in his unfailing love, in his mercy, in all he is and all he has done. Grab a concordance and see for yourself! This very verse continues ‚Äúblessed is the one who takes refuge in him‚Äù.\nIf we would taste and see, we must then trust and depend. This makes sense. When we fully commit to depending on the Lord, such that we are not trying to control our own outcome, only then may we see the goodness of God, because only then have we left him space in which to show us that goodness. As we relinquish control over our own lives, may we learn to chew on and genuinely savour the goodness of God that he reveals to us.\nTrust and depend, Amy, taste and see, and leave the Lord space to show you his goodness! üôè\n","date":"2021-10-20T06:33:00+13:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/taste-and-see-that-the-lord-is-good/joyful-vT5xrj3z1OE-unsplash_hu70af4556733b0a236593958d08853f16_711705_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/taste-and-see-that-the-lord-is-good/","title":"Taste and see that the Lord is good"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we relate to our Heavenly Father when he leaves our most earnest and desperate prayers unanswered?\n [Jesus said] ‚ÄúAsk and it will be given to you;\n\u0026hellip; how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!‚Äù\n‚Äï Matthew 7:7, 11  ‚ÄúYou may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.‚Äù\n‚Äï John 14:14 But unanswered prayer is a real thing. How can we deal with it? Many have grappled with this, and much has been written. Some have said, the Lord always answers prayer: sometimes yes; sometimes no; sometimes not yet. I find this glib and unhelpful. Because sometimes there is silence.\nImagine a husband and father, let\u0026rsquo;s call him Mark, a faithful servant of the Lord, suffering with severe health issues for so many years, for whom we have been faithfully, earnestly praying, confident that the Lord hears and is powerful to heal.

How is that a reasonable response to desperate prayers offered from a broken heart?\nThere is another way to see this. Unanswered prayer is an invitation into relationship. An invitation into intimacy. How does this work? Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a conversation.\n You: ‚ÄúWhy did Mark have to die?

Paul writes:\n I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and his incomparably great power for us who believe.

The Lord had given victory to Syria through Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army (v1, how interesting), who suffered from leprosy. Previously, the Syrians had taken captives from Israel, and among them was a young girl, now a slave in the house of Naaman (v2). Not even named, and yet her faith makes her the hero of this story. How would you expect a young girl, captive in a foreign land, to live? Not like this, surely!\nShe said to her mistress, ‚ÄúIf only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy‚Äù (v3). Talk about not playing it safe and keeping your head down! What can we learn?\n She was simply and humbly living her life, a slave in Naaman\u0026rsquo;s house, with no resentment or discontent. She had a generous heart, wishing good and not harm upon her captors. She had such a conviction that through Elisha the Lord would heal Naaman the commander of the army of a hostile nation, that she was prepared to put herself on the line.  Why did she speak out like this? What trouble would have come her way if there had not been a miraculous healing? Certainly the king of Israel himself expected the outcome to be conflict between nations (v7). Her faith is ridiculous. And so she is the reason that a pagan general\u0026rsquo;s life is turned around, he becomes a worshipper of the Lord, and takes his faith back to a pagan land, into the royal palace, no less (v18).\nWe have to conclude that the Lord placed this on her heart, as he does. These were his plans and purposes, and they rested on the faith of a humble slave girl, who otherwise might simply have been living in obscurity. And on her obedience, oh my! Risk-taking, reckless obedience, to the one who is faithful beyond measure.\nLive with a faith that changes the course of nations, Amy! üôè\n","date":"2021-09-01T06:45:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/faith-that-changes-the-course-of-nations/vladislav-klapin-YeO44yVTl20-unsplash_hu0600df16f3b47413af7c8f167de955c8_1148475_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/faith-that-changes-the-course-of-nations/","title":"Faith that changes the course of nations"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s in a greeting?\nTo Amy, who is loved by God and called to be one of the saints (Rom 1:7).\nTo Amy, sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy (1 Cor 1:2).\nTo Amy, one of the faithful in Christ Jesus (Eph 1:1).\nTo Amy, one of the saints in Christ Jesus (Phil 1:1).\nTo Amy, a faithful sister in Christ (Col 1:2).\nTo Amy in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thes 1:1).\nTo Amy my true daughter in the faith (1 Tim 1:2).\nTo Amy, my dear daughter (2 Tim 1:2).\nTo Amy our dear friend and fellow worker (Philemon 1:1).\nTo Amy, a stranger in the world, one of God‚Äôs elect scattered throughout the provinces of Papua New Guinea, chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood (1 Peter 1:1-2).\nTo Amy, who through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ has received a faith as precious as ours (2 Peter 1:1).\nTo Amy, who has been called, who is loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ (Jude v1).\nQuite a lot, it seems!\nReceive the truth and love in these greetings, Amy! üôè\n","date":"2021-08-25T06:45:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/greetings/church-of-the-king-j9jZSqfH5YI-unsplash_hubc4e61f5149c4ac37bae04f6a728d595_2797393_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/greetings/","title":"Greetings"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWhat does it mean to receive the kingdom of God like a little child?\nWhat a vital question!

When the parent says it is so, or tells of something they will do, the child never doubts for a moment. The child wastes no energy at all worrying about it. They count on it, as if it were already so.\nSecondly, the little child depends, completely. In fact their life makes no sense unless the parent provides, protects, cares, loves. They are wholly dependent. It is the very nature of the relationship.\nThirdly, have you ever observed a little child anticipating something to come, something wonderful, like Christmas? They are so excited! The expectation can be almost too much to bear. And as the event approaches, the excitement grows, contagiously.\nLet us receive the kingdom of God like this.

Personally, I doubt it was any disability, of speech or of stature, nor any severe pain to endure. Rather I suspect it was something utterly shameful and humiliating, perhaps something in his own character. Something internal and deeply personal. Why do I think this?\nIn every other respect, Paul was the elite. Highly educated. Highly disciplined. Highly capable. Zealous. Purging every sin and making every effort to live a right life (Acts¬†22:3, Phil¬†3:4-6). These are not attributes that lead to humility! They are more likely to lead to arrogance, to smug self-satisfaction, to a sense of moral superiority. How can such a one be depending completely on the Lord, and be of any use in the Kingdom?\nPaul rather was able to live with so much humility and dependence on the Lord because of this (‚Äúin order to keep me from becoming conceited‚Äù, 2¬†Cor¬†12:7), being able to say, ‚ÄúChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners ‚Äî of whom I am the worst‚Äù (1¬†Tim¬†1:15).

How should we approach them?\nMy intention this week was to write about telling a mountain to throw itself into the sea, not doubting. But when I looked into the context, I found that Jesus said it after cursing the fig tree on approaching Jerusalem for the last week of his life. How do we understand that? Let\u0026rsquo;s think about that first, and I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to the mountain another time.\n The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, ‚ÄúMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.‚Äù And his disciples heard him say it.\nIn the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.\n‚Äï Mark 11:12-14, 20 How is this reasonable? It was not the season for figs! This seems so harsh. It is certainly hard to understand. What should we do with passages like this?\nFirstly, we ought not to anthropomorphize the tree. It was just a tree. It served a purpose, to illustrate a teaching point of Jesus. Nobody suffered in the making of this point. But still!\nThe worst comment I read about this explained that first fruits appear early, and Jesus would have expected there to be figs for that reason. But Mark would have known that, and would have said, there were no first fruits. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t the reason given! Let us not second guess the gospel writers. The Lord is responsible for his own reputation, and has no need of our defence, no need of our pitiful attempts to make him look good. Let us not brush aside these difficulties with bogus explanations.\nJesus was about to suffer and die, for the sins of all humanity. This was God\u0026rsquo;s plan, and it required rejection and brutal treatment of the Son of God by those who should have been fruitful for the Kingdom, but were not. Was the fig tree a symbol of the Jews who rejected Jesus? It was not their season to be fruitful, and they were severely judged. Is this harsh? It is a hard teaching!\nWe cannot claim perfect understanding of the mysteries of God. But as we grapple, let us do so with intellectual integrity, being faithful to Scripture, and honouring the Lord. And may we continue to love and trust him when the limits of our understanding are exceeded.\nLove and trust, Amy, and don\u0026rsquo;t stop grappling! üôè\n","date":"2021-07-28T06:39:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/hard-teaching/maranda-vandergriff-9mqdPNk2Xwc-unsplash_hufe739519e9d947e9f891b62db9011e53_2599297_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/hard-teaching/","title":"Hard teaching"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nHow can we be expectant and not disappointed?\nLiving with high expectations of oneself and others is surely right, but can lead to ongoing disappointment, as we and those around us fall short of what we aspired to do and to be.

Is anything too hard for me?‚Äù\n‚Äï Jeremiah 32:27 How are we not just setting ourselves up for disappointment?\nHowever we deal with this, we must never lower our expectation of the Lord. He is the Creator, Almighty, Sovereign Lord, infinite in power and wisdom. He loves us his children absolutely, and he blesses us richly and without bounds. May we never doubt that! And may we never limit our praying to what seems reasonable. If someone is sick, shame on me if I pray merely for their comfort rather than for miraculous healing.\nTo live with such expectation makes me so vulnerable, though. Vulnerable to disappointment. Vulnerable to the scorn of the sceptics. Vulnerable and defenceless. How can my faith survive this?\nRecall that Abraham was strengthened in his faith (Rom¬†4:20). It is a work of the Lord. I commit completely, in faith, trusting. The Lord defends me. It is miraculous grace. The heartache may remain as I wait, in that amalgam of joy and pain which characterises the Christian life as we engage with the Lord\u0026rsquo;s work in this broken world. But disappointment does not crush me, does not crush my faith. How does this work? It is a mystery, a wondrous gift of grace.\nOh my, I seem to have written another tome.

Twenty-five years!\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s account in Romans 4 manages to overlook Abraham\u0026rsquo;s shameful failure (oh the grace of God!), and we find this:\n Yet Abraham did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.\n‚Äï Romans 4:20-21 He believed again, and walked by faith. What then happened? He was strengthened in his faith. Notice what happened here. He believed. He exercised faith. Just enough. Perhaps barely enough, but enough all the same. And the Lord strengthened him in that faith. And it was God who was thus glorified, not Abraham.\nBut the most striking consequence is found just before this.\n Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations.\n‚Äï Romans 4:18 Notice that little word, so. What was the reason Abraham became the father of many nations? Because he believed.\nWhen we walk by faith, God fulfills his plans and purposes in us and through us. There is a causal link.

Here are the four most oppressive words, that empty us of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s power and make us utterly useless for him: what will they think?\nWhat will they think of me? I choose not to care!

That would be a long list to be sure. I\u0026rsquo;ll pick one thing.\nRecently I got to see Les Mis√©rables at the Regent. What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad ‚Äî I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears. The saddest song? Some would say I Dreamed a Dream, and that is indeed crushing (‚Äúnow life has killed the dream I dreamed‚Äù), or On My Own, √âponine\u0026rsquo;s song of unrequited love for Marius (‚Äúthe trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers‚Äù). But there is another: Javert\u0026rsquo;s soliloquy, Stars.\nJavert is the policeman who pursues the protagonist Jean Valjean through the decades, after he breaks parole from a 19 year sentence of slavery for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Valjean receives unexpected grace and repents (‚ÄúI feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?‚Äù). Thus he begins a sacrificial life of love, but Javert cannot accept this. Stars is his vow to pursue Valjean and never rest until he is again behind bars. He sings, ‚Äúmine is the way of the Lord‚Äù (he is so wrong), and ‚Äúthose who falter and those who fall must pay the price‚Äù (wrong again, Javert ‚Äî Rom¬†8:1-4, 31-39).\nAn isolated sad event cannot be a tragedy, no matter how heart-rending, as explained by Educating Rita\u0026rsquo;s teacher. Rather, a tragedy is the long and apparently inescapable trajectory of a life, set in motion by a particular course of events or an attitude of the heart, leading inexorably to one\u0026rsquo;s own destruction. It is the prolonged inevitability which makes it so. Javert eventually takes his own life, the only possible consequence given his Pharisaical heart, hardened over so many years.\nMany today live Javert\u0026rsquo;s life, bereft of grace. Each one is a tragedy, and each one breaks our Father\u0026rsquo;s heart.\nLove with the Father\u0026rsquo;s love, Amy! üôè\n","date":"2021-05-26T06:46:00+12:00","image":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-pharisaical-heart/tamara-gore-P4mxBJtINCw-unsplash_hu46510db4cb279d99173f70d632c69551_381707_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://letterstoamy.org/the-pharisaical-heart/","title":"The Pharisaical heart"},{"content":"Dear Amy,\nWho am I?\nWhat a vital question that is for any of us.
