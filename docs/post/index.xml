      <description>Dear Amy,
Why is it so important to be vulnerable?
Our every instinct is to protect and defend, to justify ourselves, and yet we must not do it! Why is this? Paul wrote to the Corinthians about his vision and the thorn in his flesh (2 Cor 12:1-10), concluding: the Lord said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me &amp;hellip; I delight in weaknesses &amp;hellip; for when I am weak, then I am strong.</description>

      <title>The Pharisaical Heart</title>

      <description>Dear Amy,
What breaks our Father&amp;rsquo;s heart? That would be a long list to be sure. I&amp;rsquo;ll pick one thing.
Recently I got to see Les Misérables at the Regent. What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad — I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears.</description>

      <title>Changing the Past</title>

      <description>Because I botched the formatting of Bonhoeffer&amp;rsquo;s poem (sorry about that), it seemed appropriate to follow up with this as a little bonus.
 Changing The Past
The past is the past for a reason.
That is where it is supposed to stay,
But some cannot let it go.
In their heads it eats away
Until all their focus becomes
The person they used to be,
The mistakes they made in their life.</description>

      <title>Who am I?</title>

      <description>Dear Amy,
Who am I?
What a vital question that is for any of us. It could take some time to answer! In fact, I have had to revisit it myself in recent years.
The most valiant attempt I know of to grapple with this is by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor who was imprisoned in Flossenbürg concentration camp by the Nazis during World War II. He was executed just one month before the end of the war.</description>

      <title>Why is life so hard?</title>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/why-is-life-so-hard/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
Why is life so hard?
Consider: the young person, to whom life seems so bleak they turn to self harm to try to anchor to reality; the older person who lives alone, who may go days without speaking with another, having long forgotten what it&amp;rsquo;s like to give and receive a hug; the faithful believer waiting on the Lord for the fulfillment of a promise, praising him in the heart-breaking years of waiting, or the one crying out for healing and enduring debilitating pain in the waiting and the praising; the grief in the death of a child.</description>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-can-we-love-the-lord-this-much/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we love the Lord this much?
There&amp;rsquo;s a clue in Revelation 4:8, where the four living creatures, day and night, never stop saying: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.” And in Revelation 5:9, where together with the twenty-four elders, they sing to Jesus, “&amp;hellip; you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
How much can we love the Lord?
Recently in church we were invited to speak out our praise to God. Woefully, every single prayer was me and us. What self-obsession! Is there any deliverance from this? Wonderfully there is, and it&amp;rsquo;s to be found in Revelation, chapters 4 and 5. Lose yourself in that for a while. Hear a hundred million angels singing, “Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise!</description>

      <title>The truth will set you free</title>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/the-truth-will-set-you-free/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;If you hold to my teaching &amp;hellip; then you will know the truth &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (John 8:31-32). Truth is more important now than ever, given the post-truth world in which we live, where people are inclined to define their own truth. Christians are not immune.
We are never more vulnerable than when we say, &amp;ldquo;the Lord told me &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; What exactly do we mean by this? What interplay of conviction, imagination, emotion and coincidence are we leaning on?</description>

      <title>Perfect love drives out fear</title>
      <link>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/perfect-love-drives-out-fear/</link>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/perfect-love-drives-out-fear/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
Here&amp;rsquo;s another observation on plain old fear, also from John&amp;rsquo;s first letter. The punchline is &amp;ldquo;perfect love drives out fear&amp;rdquo; (1 Jn 4:18), but to understand what he is saying you have to read the whole passage — the golden rule, always!
I&amp;rsquo;ll string some of it together. &amp;ldquo;If we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us&amp;rdquo; (v12). &amp;ldquo;Love is made complete &amp;hellip; because in this world we are like him&amp;rdquo; (v17).</description>

      <title>Plain old fear</title>
      <link>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/plain-old-fear/</link>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/plain-old-fear/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
There&amp;rsquo;s the fear of the Lord, and there&amp;rsquo;s plain old fear, and the two are mutually exclusive. Consider plain old fear. Fear that disempowers. Debilitates. Disembowels. Fear that blinds, and blindness that feeds fear, in a downward spiral. To see how to end it, understand how it begins. It begins with lies.
God doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about me (1 Jn 4:9-10). God has no use for me (Jer 29:11). God won&amp;rsquo;t keep his promises (Josh 23:14).</description>

      <title>Covid Prayer</title>

      <description>Dear God, my God,
You are the Lord of all creation, majestic, sovereign, good, and wise beyond our understanding. Praise your holy name! I lift up to you the situation in Amy&amp;rsquo;s village, with Covid having arrived, and along with it, fear. Forgive us when we doubt your goodness or your sovereignty. I pray the people there would hear Jesus speaking, &amp;ldquo;Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you.</description>

      <title>Forgiveness and purification</title>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/forgiveness-and-purification/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
Here&amp;rsquo;s a well loved verse from John&amp;rsquo;s first letter, that we may be in danger of reading too quickly and missing the most important word.
 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (1 Jn 1:9)
 There are some important words here. Confess. Sins. And some wonderful, lifting words. Faithful. Forgive. Purify. But what am I referring to?</description>

      <title>How to grow in reverent awe and wonder</title>
      <link>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-to-grow-in-reverent-awe-and-wonder/</link>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/how-to-grow-in-reverent-awe-and-wonder/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
So, how do we grow in reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done? Because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just happen. It takes serious get-up-early-and-cry-out-to-God hard work, every single day. Work. But not without incredible joy.
Psalm 119 helps. I won&amp;rsquo;t quote it here, because, well, it&amp;rsquo;s quite long. I have been including the first 32 verses in my daily readings for several years now.</description>

      <title>Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</title>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/fear-of-the-lord-is-the-beginning-of-wisdom/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we know the will of the Lord? Let&amp;rsquo;s look again into the treasure trove which is Psalm 25.
Who, then, are those who fear the LORD? He will instruct them in the ways he chooses (v12). The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them (v14).
Tim Keller defines the fear of the Lord as this, in a sermon from Proverbs on the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom.</description>

      <title>He guides the humble in what is right</title>
      <link>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/he-guides-the-humble-in-what-is-right/</link>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/he-guides-the-humble-in-what-is-right/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
Here is Psalm 25:8-9 for you: Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways. He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.
Notice the therefore. Meditate on it. Revel in it. See how the Lord desires for us to be holy and blameless, and yet he does not wait for that to be so, to instruct us.
The path of humility is more than these two verses.</description>

      <guid>https://letterstoamy.tesujimath.org/filled-with-the-knowledge-of-his-will/</guid>
      <description>Dear Amy,
I ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience as you begin your teaching ministry there, and so that you increasingly rely on the Lord, who provides all these things [adapted from Colossians 1:9-11].</description>

      <description>Just wondering how you are coping with the heat over there, Amy. And that made me think of this.
“But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.</description>

      <description>May you know peace from the Lord, and his provision for you, Amy, as you wait on him, and especially when things don&amp;rsquo;t turn out as you expected or hoped. Know that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s plans prevail, and &amp;hellip; he delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love. Psalm 147:11 🙏</description>
