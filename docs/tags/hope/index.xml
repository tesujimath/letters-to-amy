      <description>Dear Amy,
What is it about those who love the Lord with all of their heart, soul, mind and strength which is so profoundly attractive?
 Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.
â€• Psalm 34:5 When John had a vision on the island of Patmos of the risen Lord Jesus, he tried to describe the indescribable for us, concluding:
 His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
What are the eyes of our heart for?
I&amp;rsquo;m still stuck on this desert island, reading Ephesians 1. It is not a bad place to be! Consider what Paul writes about the eyes of our heart. (The heart is the seat of life and strength, the centre of one&amp;rsquo;s will. That is mind, soul, spirit, one&amp;rsquo;s entire emotional nature and understanding.) Paul writes:
 I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and his incomparably great power for us who believe.</description>
