&lt;p&gt;What is the fourth thing that Micah says the Lord requires from each one of us which is arguably the first in importance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/micah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Micah 6:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve already considered act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly. Do you see what&amp;rsquo;s left? &lt;em&gt;With your God.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your God⸺there&amp;rsquo;s not even a verb here! But in my view to assimilate “with your God” into “walk humbly” misses something vital and life-changing. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall what is the most important thing. The. Most. Important. Thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 12:28-31&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most important commandment is enough for us to understand “with your God”. &lt;em&gt;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.&lt;/em&gt; Nothing comes ahead of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that look like? Jesus shows us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now even more the report about [Jesus] went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities. But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 5:15-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was so much work to be done. As people heard what Jesus was doing they flooded in. We know that Jesus ministered to them with grace and kindness, but he never neglected to spend time with his Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending real quality time with someone is where love starts⸺making that a priority and ensuring that it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father&amp;rsquo;s commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 15:9-11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abide is rather an old fashioned term for stay and stay longer. We&amp;rsquo;ve considered before that the Apostle John wrote more about love than the other three gospel writers put together. Interestingly three-quarters of the occurrences of the word abide that appear in the Bible are written by John. That&amp;rsquo;s something to notice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must therefore make it an absolute priority to abide with our Heavenly Father and remain with him throughout the day, from when we wake until we sleep again. Every moment that we breathe we must spend in his presence, basking in his wonderful love and growing in our own love for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we ensure to do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding to get up earlier in the morning to spend unhurried and quality time with the Lord was for me the life-changing turning point when I left the shallows of faith and relatively meagre love for the Lord and started into deeper waters. For sure, other things were happening in my life to cause me to completely cast myself upon the Lord, but I think it was this which opened the way for him to begin his profound work of grace and healing. Abiding in his love throughout the day became possible because of the good start. And just as his mercies are new every morning, so every morning I had to begin again, with determination and great joy⸺exactly the joy that Jesus talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would we be coy about this? Is sleep more important than loving the Lord? For me it was an incremental journey, a progression in getting up earlier and then earlier again, and earlier still, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough until I had created a whole hour at the beginning of each day to immerse myself in the presence of my Heavenly Father, the one who loves me with an unfathomable love, who holds all mysteries and all power, the one that I live for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can say now as I look back on that journey is that it was so profoundly worth it! Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abide with the one who loves you, Amy, each morning and throughout the day! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Love mercy</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/love-mercy/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/love-mercy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/love-mercy/jon-tyson-nI8YlkExQoI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Love mercy" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why love mercy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/micah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Micah 6:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the ESV does have slightly unfamiliar wording here. All my Christian life I have known it as act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly. But the unfamiliar prompted me to look further into what this word mercy actually means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why love and not show? Why not “show mercy”? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that go better with those other doing words, act justly and walk humbly? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this purely about our behaviour? Not remotely! It is so much richer and deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word translated mercy or kindness is &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;. Over the last couple of weeks or so I have been on a journey into &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;, mainly thanks to Jim McClure. It has been rich and deep. As we come to understand &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; we come to understand something of the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; has been translated by a variety of words including mercy, kindness, goodness, favour, pity and loving-kindness. Sometimes it has been translated as faithfulness, grace, leal-love, steadfast love and troth. The fact that so many words have been employed to translate &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; reveals that it is extremely difficult to find an equivalent English word and every attempt is ultimately inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; is love that is covenantal and it is about relationship. God&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; is wonderful, ever present, always surrounding, universal, superlative, quick to pardon, immense in its essence, immense in its duration, immense in its quantity, and, remarkably, can be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim McClure, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://connectingwithyou.net/2016/12/12/words-of-life-5-loyal-love-chesed/&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Adapted from Words of Life #5, Loyal Love — Chêsêd&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where else does this word appear? Everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing &lt;em&gt;steadfast love&lt;/em&gt; to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 20:5b-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the paths of the LORD are &lt;em&gt;steadfast love&lt;/em&gt; and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 25:10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: The &lt;em&gt;steadfast love&lt;/em&gt; of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/lamentations&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lamentations 3:21-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By loving &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; we are loving an essential and fundamental attribute of God&amp;rsquo;s character, and ultimately we are loving God himself. By immersing ourselves in this mercy and kindness, joyously and with grateful hearts, we fall more deeply in love with our Lord and Saviour, and that changes us. How we need this mercy! The overwhelmingly good news is that it flows freely⸺as and because Jesus&amp;rsquo; blood flowed freely on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we receive this it becomes a part of us and starts to define our own character, such that we become people of mercy, &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; people. Jesus talked about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s observe what it looks like to love mercy, to live for it and because of it. Can you hear the longing here, such deep longing, for the Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let your &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; come to me, O LORD, your salvation according to your promise; then shall I have an answer for him who taunts me, for I trust in your word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 119:41-42&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when we live with such deep longing for the Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;? The answer is, we put a smile on the face of our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 147:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love mercy, Amy, and put a smile on the face of your Heavenly Father! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The nature of holiness</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-nature-of-holiness/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 06:15:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-nature-of-holiness/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-nature-of-holiness/luke-stackpoole-5Qqkjn4PFPA-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The nature of holiness" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What exactly is this holiness to which we are called?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we have some idea that it is about purity and being set apart for God, but how easy it is to misunderstand what this means. To make a generalisation, the Pharisees, as earnest as anyone has ever been in their desire to honour the Lord, so failed to understand what was required here that their very lives became an offence in God&amp;rsquo;s nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Bible dictionary includes in its definition “moral and ethical wholeness”. We would do well however to consider what the Bible itself has to say. Leviticus Chapter 19 in its entirety is going to help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy. Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, and you shall keep my Sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves any gods of cast metal: I am the LORD your God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/leviticus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 19:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holiness is very much about what we do and that what we do honours the Lord, his laws, and his precepts. But it is so much more than this, some of which we have seen already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, neither shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. And you shall not strip your vineyard bare, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the LORD your God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/leviticus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 19:9-10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holiness is also about protection and provision for the weak and the vulnerable. The Lord has a heart for such as these, and so must we if we are to be a holy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You shall not oppress your neighbour or rob him. The wages of a hired worker shall not remain with you all night until the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/leviticus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 19:13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How interesting. In a chapter on holiness, we find specific instruction that we are not to wield power over others. The hired worker is at the mercy of the one who hires him, and holiness demands that mercy be shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we get onto some aspects of holiness which may be somewhat surprising, but nevertheless must be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You shall not let your cattle breed with a different kind. You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, nor shall you wear a garment of cloth made of two kinds of material.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/leviticus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 19:19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wow! How arbitrary and irrelevant does this sound to 21st Century ears? And yet it is absolutely relevant. How so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle here is that God&amp;rsquo;s holy people, called and set apart, must never become compromised by those among whom they live. How easily do we tend towards assimilation into the practices and morality of the day. May it never be so! See how this is underlined with specific examples next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You shall not round off the hair on your temples or mar the edges of your beard. You shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead or tattoo yourselves: I am the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/leviticus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 19:27-28&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were practices of the Canaanite pagans. As prohibitions they certainly sound strange to us in these modern times, so we must reframe them. Let&amp;rsquo;s not overlook how modern pagans pipe profanity and blasphemy and lewdness directly into their living rooms via streaming television (well, perhaps not in your village, Amy!), how strangers in society are dehumanised and ostracised, how social media have displaced actual relationship, how loneliness has become normalised, how brazenly are idols pursued⸺career, success, family, respectability. In the face of all these we must remain holy, and holiness means they must be repudiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the LORD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/leviticus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 19:18, 34&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An outworking of holiness is love itself. This should not surprise us because love is the essence of moral and ethical wholeness, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? And so holiness can be understood as an attitude of the heart that completely and comprehensively honours the Lord and which is outworked both in our internal thought lives and in our external behaviour in every aspect of our lives, without compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t holiness seem to cover so much? My favourite theologian summarises it like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Christian holiness is a number of things together. It has both outward and inward aspects. Holiness is a matter of both action and motivation, conduct and character, divine grace and human effort, obedience and creativity, submission and initiative, consecration to God and commitment to people, self-discipline and self-giving, righteousness and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;J.I. Packer, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;A Passion for Holiness, Chapter 1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/leviticus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 19:2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May love and holiness be the defining characteristics of all of our lives, Amy! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Love and holiness</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/love-and-holiness/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 06:15:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/love-and-holiness/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/love-and-holiness/kanchanara-7E3QGntO66M-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Love and holiness" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If love is one side of the coin which defines how we must live our lives, what is the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the coin bears the face of Jesus, for it is his currency and our lives must reflect his own. So why is it that I am wanting to further distil this? Simply so we may grasp with crystal clarity what it really means to live our lives in a way which honours him absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already seen that love is the most important thing⸺love for the Father and love for Jesus, followed by love for one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 12:28-31&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One side of the coin is simply inscribed &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the other side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/leviticus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 19:1-2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side of the coin is inscribed &lt;em&gt;holiness&lt;/em&gt;. Love and holiness. Two sides of the same coin in fact. How so? Jesus tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you love me, you will keep my commandments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 14:15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our personal holiness must be a consequence of love. Our motivation to live with holiness must be love for the Lord, our utmost desire to honour him. There is no other way to live like this victoriously in his power and by his grace. And in this there can be no pretending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-chronicles&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Chronicles 28:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word here is &lt;em&gt;yêtser&lt;/em&gt;, which means intent. &lt;em&gt;He understands every intent of the thoughts.&lt;/em&gt; Every motive. This is both confronting and liberating. Confronting obviously. But liberating because when we stumble, which we do because that is part of what it means to be human, he understands the motive behind the thoughts. If my deepest desire is to honour my Heavenly Father, he knows this, and my stumbles are easily forgiven as simply that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love and holiness⸺this is what must define us if we are to bring him glory, fulfil his mission for us, and change the world. And this too is what must define our church if we are to have any relevance in a broken and hurting world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So each morning I awake, I resolve to honour the Lord this very day through the love and holiness of my life. It is my offering of worship to him, and it is joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursue love and holiness, Amy, with ruthless consistency and great joy! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/denial/michael-held-g_Kde88IlvE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Denial" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the nature of Jesus&amp;rsquo; love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we journey this week towards Good Friday, towards the cross, let&amp;rsquo;s reflect on Jesus&amp;rsquo; journey towards that first Good Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had just eaten his last supper with the disciples in the upper room and washed their feet, and then said something none of them expected or wanted to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.” Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.” Jesus said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 22:31-34&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in such a familiar passage, here is something to notice afresh. Jesus refers to Peter by his pre-Christian name, Simon. Why is that? Remember that he had previously given him a new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 16:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does Jesus momentarily call him Simon here and then almost immediately Peter again? How interesting. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I think about this. The crux is not that he initially calls him Simon, but that he then calls him Peter, and this is what Jesus wants to emphasize. Even as he is foretelling his denial, Jesus is affirming him as Peter, his chosen one, Cephas the rock. Even in his denial he is still Peter. He is still Jesus&amp;rsquo; chosen one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only shortly afterwards it happened just as Jesus had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, “This man also was with him.” But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.” And a little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, “Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.” But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 22:55-60&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v61a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would have been in that look from Jesus? Disappointment surely, and sadness⸺sadness beyond imagining⸺but also love, such love. Steadfast love. Irrefutable love. The love that would send Jesus to the cross, in obedience to his Father, love even unto death. Love for Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v61b-62&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter realised he had denied the Lord who loved him, who had affirmed him, and who loved him still. And in his shame and wretchedness and humiliation he wept bitterly. At the time of crisis, when Jesus was going to his death, he, Peter, had been found not to be worthy. He was nothing but a shameful failure. How he wept over that failure, his failure to love Jesus as he loved him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us, as we approach Good Friday? Where does it leave me? What of my own denial? Anxiety that denies Jesus as Saviour. Vestigial sin that seeks to deny him as Lord. Here&amp;rsquo;s where: Jesus turns and looks at me, and he loves me. In love he stretched out his arms on that cross and died for me, and for you, Amy. I know I am not worthy of this love, but it makes no difference to Jesus. His love is irrefutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the nature of his great love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember his love for you, Amy, as we approach Good Friday, and praise him! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The disciple whom Jesus loved</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-disciple-whom-jesus-loved/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 06:24:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-disciple-whom-jesus-loved/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-disciple-whom-jesus-loved/harry-quan-G1iYCeCW2EI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The disciple whom Jesus loved" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why John refers to himself throughout his gospel exclusively as “the disciple whom Jesus loved”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table at Jesus&amp;rsquo; side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 13:23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 19:26&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 20:1-2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 21:20&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John never refers to himself by name, only ever “the disciple whom Jesus loved”. Why would this be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly I want to reject the idea that Jesus loved John more than the others. That makes no sense to me, for it would mean he loved the others less, and I find that to be ridiculous. He loved without limit each and every person he encountered, just as he loves each and every one of us. There are no favourites and no less-thans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See how he loved him!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 11:5, 36&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 3:16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 3:16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other gospel writers make no use of this phrase⸺it is purely how John describes himself. This is surely the clue, that John is acutely aware of quite how loved by Jesus he is. It is not the love that is greater, but &lt;em&gt;his awareness of that love&lt;/em&gt;. And that changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a striking consequence of that level of awareness. John&amp;rsquo;s gospel has more to say about love than all three of the other gospels combined. And his first letter is all and entirely about love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We love because he first loved us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 4:19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How John understood this, and how it transformed his writing and his ministry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; response when we become aware of the boundless nature of this unfathomable love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 13:34-35&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In whatever situation we find ourselves and whatever the challenge we face, may we hear the kindly voice of the apostle John urging us, “Little children, remember to love”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is simply John&amp;rsquo;s awareness of Jesus&amp;rsquo; great love for him that enables him to describe himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved⸺an observation which has a truly wonderful corollary: each one of us can own such a description for ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you continue your ministry in the village, Amy, know that you are the teacher whom Jesus loves, and be transformed by your awareness of that love! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fully known</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/fully-known/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/fully-known/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/fully-known/miguel-bruna-ex1CRGFAftA-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Fully known" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else does God know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather a lot in fact⸺this is the omniscient Creator God of the universe we are talking about! But in particular, to understand what it means for each one of us to be known by God, let&amp;rsquo;s meditate on Psalm 139.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O LORD, you have searched me and known me! You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar. You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways. Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O LORD, you know it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 139:1-4, 13-14a, 15-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That I am known by my loving Heavenly Father quite so comprehensively and quite so intimately is truly wonderful. For one thing it completely dispels fear. All is fully known. The Lord is acquainted with all my ways. There is nothing hidden that could suddenly be revealed and remove his love for me, or for you. God already knows it all. He knows the very worst and he loves. He already knew and still he chose to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s only one thing left to say. Consider the most well known passage on love in the Bible, the passage that is read at weddings and which makes our souls sing: 1 Corinthians 13. Have you noticed Paul&amp;rsquo;s penultimate point there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-corinthians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Corinthians 13:12b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing and loving go together and they grow together. The extent to which we know another limits our love for them. Now I know the Lord only in part, which limits my love for him. Then I shall know fully and so will I love. But right here right now I am fully known by the Lord and fully loved by him. Fully loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know this, Amy: you are fully known by the Lord, and fully loved! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The grace-filled life</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-grace-filled-life/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-grace-filled-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-grace-filled-life/tom-morbey-r1SwcagHVG0-unsplash-cropped.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The grace-filled life" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are not under law but under grace, does it even matter what we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It matters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 6:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How then can we learn to walk in newness of life, not under law but under grace? If all those long lists of commandments still apply, how are we not under law? And if not, how can we avoid living in sin? Certainly not by overlooking what Jesus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like us, the fledgling church in Galatia was under threat from those preaching works. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider what Paul wrote to them. Here&amp;rsquo;s the key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/galatians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, but that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big if! How can we know, and how can we be secure in that knowledge? Because there&amp;rsquo;s a grievous trap here which snares many, namely equating being led by the Spirit with living according to the convictions of one&amp;rsquo;s own heart. This is fraught with danger! Satan is the father of lies and the great deceiver, and by stroking our egos and flattering our vanity he can manipulate our feelings even and perhaps especially in this realm. How can we escape this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/galatians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:17, 19-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first list is truly shocking, and we might be tempted to think is far from where we live our lives, but consider idolatry for one⸺in regard to career, reputation, and respectability, how evident is this in every church! Now, notice that eight out of these fifteen works of the flesh comprise dysfunctional relationship and unlove. There&amp;rsquo;s a clue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could being led by the Spirit in fact be quite straightforward? The opposite of dysfunctional relationship and unlove is simply, love. There&amp;rsquo;s more than love in the second list, of course, but that&amp;rsquo;s surely the headline. And what does Paul say elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; love is the fulfilling of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 13:10b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here indeed is the answer. We can live not under law but under grace by loving the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, and loving one another, unconditionally and without exception, in joyful surrender. Love that starts small must grow and grow and continue to grow⸺this is the fruit of the Spirit. So simple, and yet learning to do this adequately will take each one of us the rest of our earthly lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live a life of love, Amy, led by the Spirit, as one not under law but under grace! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can our hearts make melody to the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 5:18b-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word here translated &lt;em&gt;melody&lt;/em&gt; appears in only three other places in the New Testament. Here&amp;rsquo;s one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it is written, “Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and &lt;em&gt;sing&lt;/em&gt; to your name.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 15:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relates to one of David&amp;rsquo;s psalms of deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation⸺the God who &amp;hellip;  rescued me from my enemies &amp;hellip; .  For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing to your name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 18:46-49&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more than 30 years of reading the NIV 1984, I have recently switched to the ESV, a more literal translation, and I am loving both the precision and the freshness. And so I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed something here. David will sing to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s name is his character, his reputation, the essence of who he is and what he is like. And what is that? Moses once asked exactly this, and behold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children&amp;rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.” And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 34:5-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses&amp;rsquo; response is the only one possible⸺a heart-response of worship and adoration, a song to the Creator God of the universe, to the one who loves us, who is our rescuer, our rock and our redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart is an instrument of love, and this is the melody I can make to the name of the one who loves you and me both with boundless, unfathomable love, to all that he is and all that he has done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing and make melody to the Lord with your heart, Amy, to the one who has rescued us and loves us beyond imagining! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The love of God</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-love-of-god/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 06:27:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-love-of-god/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-love-of-god/theo-eilertsen-photography-mwlhFUCir_8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The love of God" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever come to realise something about the Lord which completely blew your mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We love because he first loved us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 4:19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s consider just one aspect of the nature of God&amp;rsquo;s love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life group is working its way through Jim Packer&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;Knowing God&lt;/em&gt;. Last week we came upon just such a realisation. I can&amp;rsquo;t do better than to share the extract which had this effect on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a father continues cheerful and carefree while his son is getting into trouble, or if a husband remains unmoved when his wife is in distress, we wonder at once how much love there can be in their relationship, for we know that those who truly love are only happy when those whom they love are truly happy also. So it is with God in his love for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;J.I. Packer, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Knowing God, Chapter 12, The Love of God&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already this is giving us an inkling that there could be something truly profound about the nature of God&amp;rsquo;s love that we may have overlooked. Packer continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through setting his love on human beings God has voluntarily bound up his own final happiness with theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;J.I. Packer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my! Could he really have done this? I am mind-blown already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He has set his love upon particular sinners, and this means that, by his own free voluntary choice, he will not know perfect and unmixed happiness again till he has brought every one of them to heaven. He has in effect resolved that henceforth for all eternity his happiness shall be conditional upon ours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;J.I. Packer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost beyond comprehension that the Lord would do this. How much pain, searing, lasting pain, has he taken upon himself in this decision? How much of his joy is now tied up in ours? What kind of love is this? What kind of God is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus God saves, not only for his glory, but also for his gladness. This goes far to explain why it is that there is joy (God&amp;rsquo;s own joy) in the presence of the angels when a sinner repents (Luke 15:10), and why there will be exceeding joy when God sets us faultless at the last day in his own holy presence (Jude v24). The thought passes understanding and almost beggars belief, but there is no doubt that according to Scripture, such is the love of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;J.I. Packer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider what it means that the Lord has set his love on you, Amy, and may it blow your mind! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Relational authenticity</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/relational-authenticity/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 06:30:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/relational-authenticity/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/relational-authenticity/jingming-pan-iYsrkq5qq0Q-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Relational authenticity" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the most important thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fruit of the Spirit is love &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/galatians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve left this one until last, precisely because it is the most important. Why do I say that? So many reasons, starting with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus replied: “&amp;lsquo;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&amp;rsquo;  This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: &amp;lsquo;Love your neighbour as yourself.&amp;rsquo;  All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 22:36-40&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 13:34-35&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not optional⸺there is absolutely no wriggle room here! And yet, why is it that we do not live like this? For tragically, we do not. We should be living and breathing this, all the time. Nothing matters more. But what exactly are we supposed to do as we go about our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phrase I came upon recently has really got its hooks into me: &lt;em&gt;relational authenticity&lt;/em&gt;. This is surely the starting point. Relational authenticity recognises that the one standing before me is a real person, whoever they may be. A real person with their hopes, dreams, disappointments and hurts, just like me. And the choice which is uniquely mine is whether and how to relate, to accept, to love. How do I regard them? As background noise? A diversion? A duty? Someone to look down upon? Someone to avoid? Or a whole person, with all their value and complexity and brokenness, loved by the Lord, as am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s more. Relational authenticity demands radical humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no difference &amp;hellip; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 3:22-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How this challenges ego!  But could we live like this? The prize is glorious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 2:21-22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we develop relational authenticity, this is what we will find: all of us, together, a holy temple in the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not overlook that this is the fruit of the Spirit. We grow in this as the Lord does his work of transforming grace in our lives. In my life. In yours. Softening our hearts, enabling us to love, and making us more like Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursue relational authenticity, Amy, and learn to love like Jesus, the most important thing! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Radiant disciples</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/radiant-disciples/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 06:29:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/radiant-disciples/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/radiant-disciples/autumn-goodman-vTL_qy03D1I-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Radiant disciples" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it about those who love the Lord with all of their heart, soul, mind and strength which is so profoundly attractive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 34:5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When John had a vision on the island of Patmos of the risen Lord Jesus, he tried to describe the indescribable for us, concluding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 1:16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t look at the sun, it&amp;rsquo;s far too bright. Any attempt even to look nearby overloads our retina, so all else fades into nothing. And so it is with the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord himself is the source of the radiance. Ours is merely a reflection, unlikely to cause blindness, but bright and shining nonetheless, and enormously attractive to those who don&amp;rsquo;t have it. How does this work, then? We must consider how to be those who &lt;em&gt;look to him&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with forgiveness⸺&lt;em&gt;their faces are never covered with shame&lt;/em&gt;. All is forgiven, all debt is cancelled and all shame is gone. This is the glorious truth that underpins everything we are as children of God. Rejoice in that forgiveness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It continues with hope. As we look to the Lord, we look with the hope that notwithstanding all that we have already received, his work in us is not yet complete. There&amp;rsquo;s more to come, and what is to come is so certain and so very good, and so much more than we could possibly ask or imagine. This is our source of joy, our source of radiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we love the Lord, with a grateful heart that magnifies that love, and irrepressible hope that fuels it with tremendous power. When someone is in love, absolutely captivated, they have a glow about them, evidenced in shining eyes and wonder. This is powerful and joyous, and others desire it. May we know this as we look to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look to him, Amy, bask in his glory which shines like the sun in all its brilliance, and be radiant! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rescue</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/rescue/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 06:30:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/rescue/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/rescue/axel-antas-bergkvist-zrSzqDnfkQ8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Rescue" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times will the Lord rescue? Isn&amp;rsquo;t once enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because she loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue her”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 91:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, my Bible actually says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But gender is of no consequence here. What matters is this: the pronoun is singular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some think the only rescue is the body-and-blood-of-Christ one that saves us from our sin and brings us into relationship with our Heavenly Father, but that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning. Notice this: “Because she loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue her”.  This is someone who is &lt;em&gt;already in relationship&lt;/em&gt;. The rescue is ongoing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fourth of July this year should have been the last day of my life. I was in Rarotonga, in a kayak, in a place I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been on that monster-surf day, caught in a rip in the Avaavaroa Passage. The waves were pounding on the exposed reef, and after ten minutes, two capsizes, and exhaustion, I knew I was going to die. I cried out to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge wave rolled in, picked me up, and carried me on the boiling white-water all the way to the inside, a hundred metres or so, to the calm water in the lagoon, with the only thought in my head being, “Why am I not capsizing? This is impossible!” And it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been a silly boy, but there was no judgment from the Lord. All I received was this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it is, regardless of whether the crisis is quite so acute as was mine, quite so physical. Perhaps the one is in community, well regarded, serving the Lord. But nevertheless captive. Oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because she loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue her”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know this, Amy, the rescue is ongoing! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What does the Lord want us to do?</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/what-does-the-lord-want-us-to-do/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 06:51:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/what-does-the-lord-want-us-to-do/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/what-does-the-lord-want-us-to-do/robert-nyman--ysyCHixMHU-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What does the Lord want us to do?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the Lord want us to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely there must be some special work that he&amp;rsquo;s calling us to. Something that we have to carefully and prayerfully uncover, so we can live the life he has planned, and do the work he has for us. Surely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was once asked exactly this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What must we do to do the works God requires?”  Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 6:28-29&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a little enigmatic, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? Or is it? Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s actually really straightforward! What would that look like? To believe in the one the Lord has sent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the very Son of God, came to rescue us. From sin, and shame, and failure, and all that drags us down. From the sin that separated us from the Father. He loves us so much, that he did this completely and comprehensively, and at what cost!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to really believe in him.  I am loved. I am rescued. I am free. No doubt. No fear. No shame. Only love. By our Father, and for our Father.  All that remains is to live in that love. In him, and through him, and for him, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live like you&amp;rsquo;re loved, Amy! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we love the Lord this much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a clue in Revelation 4:8, where the four living creatures, day and night, never stop saying: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.”  And in Revelation 5:9, where together with the twenty-four elders, they sing to Jesus, “&amp;hellip; you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two people are in love, truly, madly, deeply, they think about each other a lot. Like, all the time! Detachment from reality may be observed. They think about each other&amp;rsquo;s attributes, the very best, and it fuels their love. David does this of the Lord in Psalm 145.  “Every day I will praise you” (v2) because “great is the LORD and most worthy of praise” (v3) “&amp;hellip; and I will meditate on your wonderful works” (v5). He goes on to remind himself and us of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s attributes (v8-9, 13-14, 17-20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read these verses. Meditate on them. Dwell in them. Express your love for the Lord through them. Put him at the centre, and lift him high. Adore him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must do this day and night, never ceasing, all the time!  “My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord &amp;hellip; for ever and ever” (v21).  Let us detach from the pseudo-reality that deceives us, and embrace the eternal reality. Let us feed and water our love for the Lord with endless praise, so it grows and grows, for his glory, and by his power and transforming grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love him more, Amy! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much can we love the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in church we were invited to speak out our praise to God. Woefully, every single prayer was me and us. What self-obsession! Is there any deliverance from this? Wonderfully there is, and it&amp;rsquo;s to be found in Revelation, chapters 4 and 5. Lose yourself in that for a while. Hear a hundred million angels and every creature singing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/revelation&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 5:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are any thinking about themselves, even for a moment? Not remotely! They are wholly captivated by the presence of the risen Lord Jesus, his glory and his power, and his irresistible love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us be so, and love the Lord with such a love that we forget ourselves. With a love for him that is magnified as he enlarges our hearts with his own overflowing love. Let us adore the one who is “worthy &amp;hellip; to receive glory and honour and power” (Rev 4:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love him, Amy! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another observation on plain old fear, also from John&amp;rsquo;s first letter. The punchline is &amp;ldquo;perfect love drives out fear&amp;rdquo; (1 Jn 4:18), but to understand what he is saying you have to read the whole passage⸺the golden rule, always!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll string some of it together. &amp;ldquo;If we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us&amp;rdquo; (v12).  &amp;ldquo;Love is made complete &amp;hellip; because in this world we are like him&amp;rdquo; (v17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What drives out fear, then? We must be Christ to one another, one relationship at a time. One conversation at a time. If we love as Christ loved us, we live in right relationship with God and with one another. Perspective is restored, and fear is dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray you may know the power of this in your own life, Amy. 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
