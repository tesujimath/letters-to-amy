      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we know real peace?
 The fruit of the Spirit is &amp;hellip; peace
― Galatians 5:22 Peace here is the Greek word eirene, which corresponds to the Hebrew word shalom, and could be translated as tranquility in the soul. Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want such a thing? But how can we possibly know such a peace in the turbulent and warmongering world in which we live?
Psalm 46 provides insight, and is worth reading in its entirety.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
I ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience as you begin your teaching ministry there, and so that you increasingly rely on the Lord, who provides all these things [adapted from Colossians 1:9-11].</description>
