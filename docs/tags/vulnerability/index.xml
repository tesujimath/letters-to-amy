      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we be expectant and not disappointed?
Living with high expectations of oneself and others is surely right, but can lead to ongoing disappointment, as we and those around us fall short of what we aspired to do and to be. How can the same not be true of the Lord?
What should we expect of the Lord anyway? “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (Jn 10:10).</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
Why is it so important to be vulnerable?
Our every instinct is to protect and defend, to justify ourselves, and yet we must not do it! Why is this? Paul wrote to the Corinthians about his vision and the thorn in his flesh, concluding:
 The Lord said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me &amp;hellip; I delight in weaknesses &amp;hellip; for when I am weak, then I am strong.</description>
