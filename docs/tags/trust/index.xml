      <description>Dear Amy,
Certain passages or verses in the Bible are really hard to understand. How should we approach them?
My intention this week was to write about telling a mountain to throw itself into the sea, not doubting. But when I looked into the context, I found that Jesus said it after cursing the fig tree on approaching Jerusalem for the last week of his life. How do we understand that?</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we live confidently in the Lord&amp;rsquo;s love?
Psalm 27 pretty much has it all. Here are the highlights. “The LORD is my light and my salvation &amp;hellip; the stronghold of my life (v1). One thing I ask from the LORD &amp;hellip; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life (v4). He will keep me safe in his dwelling &amp;hellip; and set me high upon a rock (v5).</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we live confidently when the future is uncertain?
There are so many things we would like to know. What will I do with my life? Will it be worthwhile? How will I live? Will I be able to use the talents God has given me for his glory? Where will I go? Is my soul mate out there somewhere? Will I be alone? How can I know I will be ok?</description>

      <description>Just wondering how you are coping with the heat over there, Amy. And that made me think of this.
“But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.</description>
