      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we relate to our Heavenly Father when he leaves our most earnest and desperate prayers unanswered?
 [Jesus said] “Ask and it will be given to you &amp;hellip; how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!” (Matthew 7:7, 11)
“You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” (John 14:14)
 But unanswered prayer is a real thing.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
What does it mean to receive the kingdom of God like a little child?
What a vital question! Jesus himself said, “Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it” (Luke 18:17). We must fathom this then! Let&amp;rsquo;s consider three aspects of a little child&amp;rsquo;s relationship with their earthly parents, and infer how to receive from our heavenly father.</description>

      <title>Throwing a mountain into the sea</title>

      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we throw a mountain into the sea?
What a ridiculous question! It&amp;rsquo;s clearly impossible. And yet, Jesus said,
 “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.” (Mk 11:23)
 Why would Jesus say such a thing? Is he mocking us?</description>

      <title>Hard teaching</title>

      <description>Dear Amy,
Certain passages or verses in the Bible are really hard to understand. How should we approach them?
My intention this week was to write about telling a mountain to throw itself into the sea, not doubting. But when I looked into the context, I found that Jesus said it after cursing the fig tree on approaching Jerusalem for the last week of his life. How do we understand that?</description>

      <title>Living confidently in the Lord&#39;s love</title>

      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we live confidently in the Lord&amp;rsquo;s love?
Psalm 27 pretty much has it all. Here are the highlights. “The LORD is my light and my salvation &amp;hellip; the stronghold of my life (v1). One thing I ask from the LORD &amp;hellip; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life (v4). He will keep me safe in his dwelling &amp;hellip; and set me high upon a rock (v5).</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we live confidently when the future is uncertain?
There are so many things we would like to know. What will I do with my life? Will it be worthwhile? How will I live? Will I be able to use the talents God has given me for his glory? Where will I go? Is my soul mate out there somewhere? Will I be alone? How can I know I will be ok?</description>

      <description>Just wondering how you are coping with the heat over there, Amy. And that made me think of this.
“But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.</description>
