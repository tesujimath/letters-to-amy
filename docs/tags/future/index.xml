How can we know for sure that all we are hoping for in eternity is real, and that it will be as promised?
I think I&amp;rsquo;m just about ready to leave this desert island, and I see a boat on the horizon (yay!), but first let&amp;rsquo;s look into Ephesians 1 for one last time.
 And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation.</description>
