      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we throw a mountain into the sea?
What a ridiculous question! It&amp;rsquo;s clearly impossible. And yet, Jesus said,
 “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.” (Mk 11:23)
 Why would Jesus say such a thing? Is he mocking us?</description>
