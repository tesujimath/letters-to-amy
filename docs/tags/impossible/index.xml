        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-gordian-knot/gordian-knot-coin.webp" alt="Featured image of post The Gordian knot" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you untangle a Gordian knot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you know the legend of the knot so complex and tangled, for which the one who released it would be bestowed with glory and honour? Alexander the Great famously drew his sword and sliced it apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the problems we face in life, or the problems faced by those we know‚∏∫problems so complex and tangled that they are utterly beyond us, intractable problems, Gordian problems‚∏∫shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we expect the Lord simply to slice them apart triumphantly as did Alexander? Why does he not do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we find instead? That the Lord&amp;rsquo;s response to our prayers, his mighty work of great power, is so painfully slow that we can barely see headway. How can our faith withstand this? How can we endure the waiting, the ongoing nature of such a problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could there be another way to see this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter tells us straightforwardly what we should expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Peter 3:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. In the light of this verse I remember chuckling self-deprecatingly to myself that all my problems would be sorted out in a couple of days. God time is slow, slow, slow time. Isn&amp;rsquo;t the waiting simply infuriating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three observations that enable us to endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let&amp;rsquo;s notice that Peter addresses his readers as beloved. That&amp;rsquo;s us! We are beloved of the Lord, and whatever the situation and no matter how long the waiting, we must not forget that. Notice the tenderness and understanding here, as Peter articulates that the wait may be prolonged. The Lord is not oblivious of nor indifferent to our pain in the waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, let&amp;rsquo;s notice that Alexander the Great was in fact a brutal warlord who left in his wake death and destruction. Slicing through the knot in the way that he did reflects who he was. The Lord is so completely not like this. Consider the very next verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lord is not slow to fulfil his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Peter 3:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord is so unlike the brutal warlord. With infinite patience and painstaking attention to detail, he unpicks and untangles the most intractable problems in our lives, with such gentleness and amazing kindness, prepared to take as long as is necessary, not wishing that any should perish but that all should reach repentance. It is not slowness at all. It is in fact gentleness and kindness and meticulous restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly and finally, let&amp;rsquo;s notice the symmetry in Peter&amp;rsquo;s characterisation: with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. For sure, some things take such a long time, and we struggle to understand why this would be so. But for others or even for these at just the right time, in a moment, in a twinkling of the eye, the Lord does his work of great power and quite suddenly everything is different. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave the Gordian problems to the Lord, Amy, and trust that with infinite patience, gentleness, and kindness, he knows what to do! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Impossible</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/impossible/isaac-quesada-dZYI4ga2eUA-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Impossible" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we receive it when God speaks the impossible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have many examples of God speaking something impossible. Why does he do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua was told to march the Israelite army around the walls of Jericho for seven days, and the walls would collapse, but even before he was so instructed, we find this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD said to Joshua, ‚ÄúSee, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Joshua 6:2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if it had already happened! Joshua had to act on the basis that something impossible would happen. (And it did.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably Abraham had it even harder. He had to wait on an impossible promise, for twenty-five years! Waiting is perhaps harder than doing. And waiting for twenty-five years?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other examples in the Bible of God speaking the impossible. But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: &lt;em&gt;he is still doing it today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI the LORD do not change.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Malachi 3:6a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 13:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible itself teaches that we are to understand it in terms of our own experience when it says that Paul, Barnabas and Elijah were human beings like us and that Jesus knows how we feel in our weaknesses because he himself ‚Äúin every respect has been tested as we are‚Äù (Heb 4:15). It means that &lt;em&gt;their experience was substantially like our own&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must pray for the faith and for the experiences that would enable us to believe that &lt;em&gt;such things could happen to us&lt;/em&gt;. Only then will we be able to recognize, accept and dwell in them when they come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dallas Willard, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hearing God, Chapter 2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How then can we receive it when God speaks the impossible? It is in fact a high honour, an invitation to demonstrate radical faith, and to grow in that faith. Perhaps God reserves such things for those for whom he has great plans, which will require great faith. (That&amp;rsquo;s a little scary, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?)  No-one starts with such faith, but the Lord in his wisdom knows what he is doing.  Again, consider Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I hold on to this verse, which has kept me going for some years, and was itself given to me in a miraculous way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfil?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Numbers 23:19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This remains even if the promise is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: ‚ÄúI am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 32:26-27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait on the Lord in faith, Amy, knowing that he who promised is faithful (Heb 10:23), even if it seems impossible!  üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Throwing a mountain into the sea</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/throwing-a-mountain-into-the-sea/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/throwing-a-mountain-into-the-sea/sulthan-auliya-WLORfDtl7oM-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Throwing a mountain into the sea" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we throw a mountain into the sea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a ridiculous question! It&amp;rsquo;s clearly impossible. And yet, Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTruly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‚ÄòGo, throw yourself into the sea,‚Äô and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 11:23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would Jesus say such a thing? Is he mocking us? Is he exaggerating? Is he lying, even?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone tells us something that is hard to accept, how we receive it depends critically on who they are, and what we know of them. Can we trust? And what reason do we have for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After so many years, I have learnt that I can trust Jesus absolutely. I&amp;rsquo;m quite a slow learner, and have doubted in various ways for so much of my life, but no longer. I choose therefore to believe that Jesus was telling the truth when he said this impossible thing. What do I make of it then? I have to relate it to other things I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said a similar thing to his disciples at the Last Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 14:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here we have the caveat, ‚Äúin my name‚Äù. I can only ask for something in Jesus&amp;rsquo; name if he would have asked for the same. That&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful guideline for praying in power, and it defines my own expectation in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I choose to believe Jesus. I can&amp;rsquo;t throw a mountain into the sea, only because I cannot escape my own doubt about that. I acknowledge that as the reason. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t doubt, it would be so. That is on me. Jesus is trustworthy and true, and he speaks truth. And there are so many other things I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pray for, believing, not doubting. Impossible things, even. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray in power, Amy, believing and not doubting! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
