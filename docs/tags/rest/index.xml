&lt;p&gt;Where does weariness come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that state of emptiness and exhaustion which I wrote about previously, where we find we have absolutely nothing left in the tank. At those times we critically need the Lord&amp;rsquo;s grace and kindness and healing and restoration‚∏∫which he is truly so ready to provide. Instead for now I mean to address those times when things are tending to get on top of us in a smaller way, when nevertheless so much of what we have to do is a trial, when everything seems unreasonably harder than it ought, when life itself has become really quite wearying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus spoke into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Come to me, all who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 11:28-30&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words are so very familiar, and yet at the same time counter-intuitive. Why is it that our rest is found in other work, in taking his yoke upon us? Couldn&amp;rsquo;t we just, well, rest?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if by rest we mean doing nothing in particular, that is not in itself refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a major source of weariness: those many things in life that we are tempted to approach with the mindset that we can influence, that we know what to do, that we can engineer our desired outcome, for which we have our own agenda. Frustratingly though, such things are so often beyond us. Such thinking is utterly wearying and we must give it over to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, what is Jesus&amp;rsquo; work for us? To live with humility, surrendered to the Father&amp;rsquo;s will, to &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; plans and purposes, pursuing love and holiness, caring for the outcast and the brokenhearted, bringing gentleness and kindness and light and grace and hope. This is the work that brings rest to our souls. And let&amp;rsquo;s notice that a yoke is fastened over the necks of &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; animals. Jesus himself walks alongside us in this work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhich commandment is the most important of all?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus answered, ‚ÄúThe most important is, ‚ÄòHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.‚Äô The second is this: ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbour as yourself.‚Äô There is no other commandment greater than these.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 12:28b-31&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love the Lord with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, Amy, and love your neighbour as yourself, and leave the rest to him! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/green-pastures/benjamin-davies-Zm2n2O7Fph4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Green pastures" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the greatest gift that can be given?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question came into my head after listening to your voice on Monday, and my heart went out to you. At once I wanted to type out a message of love and encouragement for you. I wanted to reach out and give you a hug. Then I realised my question wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right. The greatest gift isn&amp;rsquo;t mine to give. It is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s. The greatest gift that is mine to give is to remind you of his gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I&amp;rsquo;m doing as I write to you is to remind you of things you already know. I am very aware of that! And I am not writing as someone who has it all together, as someone who has arrived, so to speak. By no means! I write as a fellow traveller, still on the journey, seeking to honour the Lord with every fibre of my being, with every breath of my life, as are you. Facing knocks and pitfalls and discouragements and sorrow and pain and weariness, as are you. I write what encourages my own heart on this journey, praying that it may also bless you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh Amy, know this, which is so familiar, and yet may be overlooked. Here is my gift of love and encouragement for you, this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 23:1-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I need that. You need that. Let us receive it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes me lie down in green pastures. He knows what I need. Oh how he knows that! He knows what you need, Amy. He leads me beside quiet waters. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider for a moment how to receive this gift from the one who knows us and loves us beyond understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall what I wrote to you right back in the beginning, when you had only just arrived in the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBlessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 17:7-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here then is how we receive this gift from Psalm¬†23. &lt;em&gt;We trust the Lord&lt;/em&gt;. We choose to trust him, even though the way ahead is hard and we are weary. His grace is sufficient for us. For me. For you. I choose to trust that it is, casting myself upon him, depending on him, his power made perfect in my weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as I trust him in this way, what does he do? &lt;em&gt;He restores my soul&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust that he knows you, Amy, trust that he loves you, lie down in his green pastures and have your soul restored! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tranquility in the soul</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/tranquility-in-the-soul/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/tranquility-in-the-soul/capturing-the-human-heart-i9uIhSlOWYc-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Tranquility in the soul" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we know real peace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fruit of the Spirit is &amp;hellip; peace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/galatians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace here is the Greek word &lt;em&gt;eirene&lt;/em&gt;, which corresponds to the Hebrew word shalom, and could be translated as &lt;em&gt;tranquility in the soul&lt;/em&gt;. Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want such a thing? But how can we possibly know such a peace in the turbulent and warmongering world in which we live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 46 provides insight, and is worth reading in its entirety. The world it describes doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so very different from our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mountains fall into the heart of the sea,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 46:2, 6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an apparently chaotic and tempestuous world this is.  And yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He lifts his voice, the earth melts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a voice that is! Tranquility in the soul is rooted in the absolute surety that the Lord is sovereign, infinite in power, so very good, and that he loves us beyond imagining. Only so can we rest in him, completely and comprehensively, and have this peace that defies circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He breaks the bow and shatters the spear;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBe still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v9, 10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem that the world is out of control, but this is illusory and temporary.  Ultimately, God will be exalted in all the earth. In such times as these, we must be still, and in the stillness we can know this, with certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be still, and know that he is God, Amy, and grow in tranquility in the soul! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
