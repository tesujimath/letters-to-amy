        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/uneven-blessing/atul-pandey-0f3bZHXZSz8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Uneven blessing" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that some seem to receive more bounteous blessing from the Lord than others? How is that fair? And how is it congruent with a God of justice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with fair, and let&amp;rsquo;s be frank. What would be fair would be for each one of us to be cast into the fiery pit. And collectively, we must take responsibility through our wretched ancestors for much of the suffering of humankind, for we share the same rebellious spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because you have &amp;hellip; eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ cursed is the ground because of you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 3:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, and this is a wonderful, unmerited, joyous but,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a rescue! What a Saviour! Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with grateful, praising hearts, in fear and trembling, let us dare to ask again, how is it that God&amp;rsquo;s blessing is quite so unevenly distributed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul grappled with such a question in relation to the election of the gentiles and God&amp;rsquo;s apparent rejection of the nation of Israel (Romans 9-11). That he takes three chapters over this shows us that such questions are no small matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take some of his arguments and apply them to the more general question of uneven blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God&amp;rsquo;s part? By no means! For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 9:14-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all mercy, and it is all undeserved. And let us not forget that the giver is the Creator God of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honourable use and another for dishonourable use? What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 9:21-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow in the unevenness of the blessing, God is making known the riches of his glory. Paul also shows us how to respond in the face of the apparent injustice of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brothers, my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 10:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And observe the extent of his love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 9:2-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this then the key to understanding? Even as we cry out to God over the unevenness of the blessing, is this our opportunity to learn how to truly love, and in so doing to glorify God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 25:35-36, 40&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the Lord enlarge our hearts for this broken world as we look around and see places where his blessing seems to be absent. And let us cry out to him for mercy, to the Lord, our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you think we have arrived at a place of only partial understanding, let us observe that Paul himself, the great apostle and teacher, is in just that place after three chapters of his own wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 11:33, 36&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cry out, Amy, to the one who is wise beyond understanding, and in places of meagre blessing love with his own love, from him and through him and to him, for his glory forever! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An axe-head floats</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/an-axe-head-floats/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 06:24:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/an-axe-head-floats/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/an-axe-head-floats/hendrik-cornelissen-x59BNivBcQ8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post An axe-head floats" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a floating axe-head provide insight into the Father-heart of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Elisha and his servants and the company of the prophets] went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees [to build a place for them to live]. As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axe-head fell into the water. “Oh, my lord,” he cried out, “it was borrowed!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float. “Lift it out,” he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Kings 6:4-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a curious little account. How are we to understand it? Firstly, let&amp;rsquo;s note just what a man of God Elisha was. When Elijah was handing down to him the mantle of being the Lord&amp;rsquo;s prophet, Elisha asked to inherit a double portion of his spirit. (How cheeky was that? — 2 Kings 2:1-15) He certainly received it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the axe-head then. Losing an axe-head would have been no small matter—there was certainly no Mitre 10 Mega to provide a replacement. And consider the shame of losing borrowed equipment, especially something so valuable. But still, surely a trivial thing in the light of eternity? Why would the Lord even care? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t he be more concerned with the learning and growth opportunity afforded by suffering such a loss? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this life supposed to be about learning to suffer and submit to such? How easily we could fail to understand the Father-heart of God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we actually see revealed here then? Here&amp;rsquo;s what. A lavish, gratuitously kind and compassionate miraculous response to a material loss. Yes, the man had been careless, and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have let this happen. But it did, and the Lord stepped in with no rebuke, demonstrating through his servant Elisha such affection and concern for one he loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it is with us. The Lord&amp;rsquo;s kindness and compassion for us is rooted in the reality of our situation. How ready he is to step in and rescue! He understands us, he understands our need, and his response is love and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run to your Heavenly Father, Amy, with any and all of your needs, because he cares for you! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A mystery revealed</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/a-mystery-revealed/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 06:38:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/a-mystery-revealed/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/a-mystery-revealed/david-clode-EDfZ0Sjmp_w-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A mystery revealed" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we know a mystery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 1:7-9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an alternate reality, the Lord could have dealt with our sin as he did, and simply told us, it&amp;rsquo;s ok, we can be friends again, I&amp;rsquo;ve sorted it out. But in our reality, &lt;em&gt;with all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will&lt;/em&gt;. He desires us to know just what our rescue cost him, and what it cost his only son, as he lavished his grace on us. As he continues to lavish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have redemption &lt;em&gt;through his blood&lt;/em&gt;. The cost was enormous. The love that paid this price, unfathomable. The forgiveness of sins and restoration of relationship with our Heavenly Father, beyond all worth. And the revelation of this mystery, according to his good pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we understand what has been done for us, and why? The Lord desires that we do. If we really grasp this, won&amp;rsquo;t it magnify our love for him a hundredfold?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know the mystery, Amy, and love the author of the mystery who has made it known! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Expectant and not disappointed</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/expectant-and-not-disappointed/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 06:45:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/expectant-and-not-disappointed/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/expectant-and-not-disappointed/patrick-fore-T2S4CatGdfQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Expectant and not disappointed" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we be expectant and not disappointed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with high expectations of oneself and others is surely right, but can lead to ongoing disappointment, as we and those around us fall short of what we aspired to do and to be. How can the same not be true of the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should we expect of the Lord anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 10:10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 27:13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 11:23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is anyone among you sick? &amp;hellip; the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;James 5:14-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 91:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the LORD your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Joshua 23:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 32:27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are we not just setting ourselves up for disappointment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However we deal with this, we must never lower our expectation of the Lord. He is the Creator, Almighty, Sovereign Lord, infinite in power and wisdom. He loves us his children absolutely, and he blesses us richly and without bounds. May we never doubt that!  And may we never limit our praying to what seems reasonable. If someone is sick, shame on me if I pray merely for their comfort rather than for miraculous healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To live with such expectation makes me so vulnerable, though. Vulnerable to disappointment. Vulnerable to the scorn of the sceptics. Vulnerable and defenceless. How can my faith survive this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that Abraham was strengthened in his faith (Rom 4:20). It is a work of the Lord. I commit completely, in faith, trusting. The Lord defends me.  It is miraculous grace.  The heartache may remain as I wait, in that amalgam of joy and pain which characterises the Christian life as we engage with the Lord&amp;rsquo;s work in this broken world. But disappointment does not crush me, does not crush my faith. How does this work? It is a mystery, a wondrous gift of grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my, I seem to have written another tome. Good job I do this only once a week, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lean on him, trust him for his impossible promises, and praise him for his miraculous grace, Amy! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Experiencing grace</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/experiencing-grace/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 06:32:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/experiencing-grace/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/experiencing-grace/denise-jans-IJy2ZUex0-Y-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Experiencing grace" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we better perceive the Lord&amp;rsquo;s grace in all we experience, and what would that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is full of frustrations and disappointments. Even for the Christian seeking the Lord with all of our heart, living a surrendered life, putting him first in everything, things may not turn out as we would have wished. And that&amp;rsquo;s not just small things. The whole course of one&amp;rsquo;s life could turn out to be so different from what was desired. Where is our loving Heavenly Father in this? Does he not want to bless his children? Absolutely he does! So what is going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote to the Romans this oft-quoted verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider that in the context of Solomon&amp;rsquo;s wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Proverbs 16:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has hopes and desires for their own life. Some may be sufficiently well organised to have a plan! But the Lord determines their steps. It is his plans and purposes that prevail. Let us not delude ourselves that we can control our own destiny, and somehow plan our way there. That is for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to dispel a misconception. Paul is not saying that everything that happens is good and is caused by God. That is observably false — terrible things do happen. Rather he is saying that whatever happens, God works in it and through it “for the good of those who love him”. Let us be those!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us learn to see the world through the lens of Romans 8:28 as it actually is then. May we consciously receive God&amp;rsquo;s grace in all that happens. “In all things” let us submit to his superior wisdom, knowing that there is no better eternal outcome than the one he has for us. When apparent disappointments come, let us receive them with a grateful heart. The Lord has seen things that we have not. His love is unfailing. He may very well be rescuing us from something we thought was better, but is in fact not.  He is the one who determines our steps, and it is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receive his grace with a grateful heart in all things, Amy! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Pharisaical heart</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-pharisaical-heart/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 06:46:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-pharisaical-heart/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-pharisaical-heart/tamara-gore-P4mxBJtINCw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Pharisaical heart" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What breaks our Father&amp;rsquo;s heart? That would be a long list to be sure. I&amp;rsquo;ll pick one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I got to see Les Misérables at the Regent. What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad — I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears. The saddest song? Some would say I Dreamed a Dream, and that is indeed crushing (“now life has killed the dream I dreamed”), or On My Own, Éponine&amp;rsquo;s song of unrequited love for Marius (“the trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers”). But there is another: Javert&amp;rsquo;s soliloquy, Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javert is the policeman who pursues the protagonist Jean Valjean through the decades, after he breaks parole from a 19 year sentence of slavery for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Valjean receives unexpected grace and repents (“I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?”). Thus he begins a sacrificial life of love, but Javert cannot accept this. Stars is his vow to pursue Valjean and never rest until he is again behind bars. He sings, “mine is the way of the Lord” (he is so wrong), and “those who falter and those who fall must pay the price” (wrong again, Javert — Rom 8:1-4, 31-39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An isolated sad event cannot be a tragedy, no matter how heart-rending, as explained by Educating Rita&amp;rsquo;s teacher. Rather, a tragedy is the long and apparently inescapable trajectory of a life, set in motion by a particular course of events or an attitude of the heart, leading inexorably to one&amp;rsquo;s own destruction. It is the prolonged inevitability which makes it so. Javert eventually takes his own life, the only possible consequence given his Pharisaical heart, hardened over so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many today live Javert&amp;rsquo;s life, bereft of grace. Each one is a tragedy, and each one breaks our Father&amp;rsquo;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love with the Father&amp;rsquo;s love, Amy! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
