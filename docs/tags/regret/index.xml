      <description>Because I botched the formatting of Bonhoeffer&amp;rsquo;s poem (sorry about that), it seemed appropriate to follow up with this as a little bonus.
 Changing The Past
The past is the past for a reason.
That is where it is supposed to stay,
But some cannot let it go.
In their heads it eats away
Until all their focus becomes
The person they used to be,
The mistakes they made in their life.</description>
