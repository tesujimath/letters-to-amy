        <title>The belt of truth</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-belt-of-truth/Roman_cingulum_1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The belt of truth" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for last week&amp;rsquo;s email⸺what a lot has been going on! I hope by now you&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying your well-deserved break, and that the Lord is doing a work of refreshing and refilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your email you referred to the armour of God, which has prompted me to spend some time reflecting on that. You know how I love to unpack these things! I&amp;rsquo;ll start with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled round your waist &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 6:14a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How vital is truth. We&amp;rsquo;ll come to some specifics, but firstly, have you wondered why Paul represents truth as a belt? Why a belt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I found when I looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cingulum was the traditional Roman soldier&amp;rsquo;s belt, which only soldiers were allowed to wear, and which they wore even when off duty. The leather straps (baltea) dangling from the front of the belt with their decorative studs (bullae) were the only insignia on their uniform. The belt was about &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it is with the belt of truth. It is our fundamental identity in Christ, upon which everything else hangs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian&amp;rsquo;s identity is in truth⸺truth in who we are and truth in our status before God, sinners saved by grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no difference &amp;hellip; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 3:22b-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spiritual battle, when Satan accuses and we are tempted to despair of who we are, we must hold onto this truth: our heavenly Father already knows the very worst about us, yet still he loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 5:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our identity, and our identity is in Christ. Only by holding onto this are we able to stand firm in the spiritual battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he or she is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stand firm in this truth, Amy, which is your identity in Christ! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Amy, a faithful sister in Christ (Col 1:2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Amy, who through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ has received a faith as precious as ours (2 Peter 1:1).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The truth will set you free</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-truth-will-set-you-free/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 06:42:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-truth-will-set-you-free/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-truth-will-set-you-free/aaron-burden-TNlHf4m4gpI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The truth will set you free" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching &amp;hellip; then you will know the truth &amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 8:31-32&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is more important now than ever, given the post-truth world in which we live, where people are inclined to define their own truth. Christians are not immune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are never more vulnerable than when we say, “the Lord told me &amp;hellip;”  What exactly do we mean by this? What interplay of conviction, imagination, emotion and coincidence are we leaning on? And what grounds do we have to trust any of that? We must take great care here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providentially, the Lord has told me a great deal, all of which is trustworthy and true. It was written down long ago, over 1200 pages. My best chance to grasp the truth is to read Scripture, diligently and comprehensively, with intellectual integrity and a surrendered heart, particularly when it becomes uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching &amp;hellip;”  It is not enough to read. We have to do it, to live and breathe his teaching, habitually and unceasingly. Only then can we really understand, and know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“ &amp;hellip; and the truth will set you free.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 8:32&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be free, Amy 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Plain old fear</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/plain-old-fear/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 06:45:00 +1200</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/plain-old-fear/simon-berger-rydQVdwcgUQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Plain old fear" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s the fear of the Lord, and there&amp;rsquo;s plain old fear, and the two are mutually exclusive. Consider plain old fear. Fear that disempowers. Debilitates. Disembowels. Fear that blinds, and blindness that feeds fear, in a downward spiral. To see how to end it, understand how it begins. It begins with lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about me (1 Jn 4:9-10). God has no use for me (Jer 29:11). God won&amp;rsquo;t keep his promises (Josh 23:14). God can&amp;rsquo;t do it (Jer 32:27). It won&amp;rsquo;t end well (Rev 21:3-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is not exhaustive. But whatever the fear, when in its grip, expose the lie which birthed the fear. Here&amp;rsquo;s that joyous verse from Psalm 119 again: &amp;ldquo;I have chosen the way of truth &amp;hellip; I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free&amp;rdquo; (v30, 32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May our Lord and Saviour continue to free your heart, Amy. 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
