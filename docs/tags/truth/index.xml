&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a greeting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy, who is loved by God and called to be one of the saints (Rom 1:7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy, sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy (1 Cor 1:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy, one of the faithful in Christ Jesus (Eph 1:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy, one of the saints in Christ Jesus (Phil 1:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy, a faithful sister in Christ (Col 1:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thes 1:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy my true daughter in the faith (1 Tim 1:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy, my dear daughter (2 Tim 1:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy our dear friend and fellow worker (Philemon 1:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy, a stranger in the world, one of God’s elect scattered throughout the provinces of Papua New Guinea, chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood (1 Peter 1:1-2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy, who through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ has received a faith as precious as ours (2 Peter 1:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Amy, who has been called, who is loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ (Jude v1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a lot, it seems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receive the truth and love in these greetings, Amy! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The truth will set you free</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching &amp;hellip; then you will know the truth &amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 8:31-32&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is more important now than ever, given the post-truth world in which we live, where people are inclined to define their own truth. Christians are not immune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are never more vulnerable than when we say, “the Lord told me &amp;hellip;”  What exactly do we mean by this? What interplay of conviction, imagination, emotion and coincidence are we leaning on? And what grounds do we have to trust any of that? We must take great care here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providentially, the Lord has told me a great deal, all of which is trustworthy and true. It was written down long ago, over 1200 pages. My best chance to grasp the truth is to read Scripture, diligently and comprehensively, with intellectual integrity and a surrendered heart, particularly when it becomes uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching &amp;hellip;”  It is not enough to read. We have to do it, to live and breathe his teaching, habitually and unceasingly. Only then can we really understand, and know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“ &amp;hellip; and the truth will set you free.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 8:32&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be free, Amy 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
