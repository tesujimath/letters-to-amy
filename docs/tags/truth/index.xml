      <title>The truth will set you free</title>

      <description>Dear Amy,
Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;If you hold to my teaching &amp;hellip; then you will know the truth &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (John 8:31-32). Truth is more important now than ever, given the post-truth world in which we live, where people are inclined to define their own truth. Christians are not immune.
We are never more vulnerable than when we say, &amp;ldquo;the Lord told me &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; What exactly do we mean by this? What interplay of conviction, imagination, emotion and coincidence are we leaning on?</description>
