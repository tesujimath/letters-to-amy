        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/what-now/nathan-trampe-oOmwruKXv5U-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What now?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three years your time in the village has finally come to an end! You have served the Lord so faithfully, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not wrong in saying that you have put a smile on the face of your Heavenly Father (Psalm 147:11). Well done! Well done indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some may see your return to New Zealand as a home-coming, perhaps for you it seems to be the opposite, as you are leaving the village and the friends who have been home to you for these three long years, with whom you have journeyed sharing joys and sorrows, trials and triumphs. And as you return you&amp;rsquo;ll surely feel like a stranger in a strange land, for isn&amp;rsquo;t that what New Zealand has become?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly how it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the writer to the Hebrews describes the faith of Abel and Enoch and Noah and Abraham and Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 11:13-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living in western affluence can become so self-satisfied and complacent, distracted by comfort and privilege. Expect to find this thoroughly jarring on your return. But know that this is not your home. It is not my home. It is not any of ours. We long for a better country, a heavenly one. And in this longing of ours, astonishingly, God is not ashamed to be called our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be my last letter to you, Amy. It has been such a privilege to be able to offer you these small encouragements from afar, and I have certainly encouraged my own heart as I have sought the Lord over what to offer to you. I have one last offering for you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my question. How can I live a life of humility and contentment, honouring the Lord in the midst of all this self-satisfaction and complacency and privilege, when all around me people with agendas are chasing after the limelight and my own life seems rather small and disregarded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David has the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering. Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and my mind. For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 26:1-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I am called to live, and it is joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; love is before my eyes because I think about it all the time. In fact it is the lens through which I see the world. It rescues me and enables me even to live my life. And the overflow of that love spills into every relationship and every conversation. It is life-changing love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise him for his wonderful &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; love and faithfulness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk in your integrity, Amy, and in his faithfulness! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Walk humbly</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/walk-humbly/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 06:25:00 +1200</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/walk-humbly/jason-strull-kqBzDbiVV40-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Walk humbly" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the second most humble person in the Bible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ask who is the most humble would be too easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/numbers&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Numbers 12:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then, who is the second most humble person in the Bible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nomination is Daniel, and since last week I have been marvelling at the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that the exile to Babylon was the Lord&amp;rsquo;s long awaited judgment on the Israelites for their waywardness and apostasy over so many years. They neglected to honour him and lived such compromised lives that eventually the Lord withdrew his blessing and unleashed judgment. It is sobering indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Daniel was not like that, as we have seen. His faithfulness and whole-hearted commitment to honour the Lord no matter the cost to himself must have made him feel so alienated from his compatriots. Surely? And he must have been praying so earnestly that they would repent and join him in his own journey of faithfulness and dedication. Surely? But no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. I prayed to the LORD my God and made confession, saying, ‚ÄúO Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules. We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTo us, O LORD, belongs open shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/daniel&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Daniel 9:3-6, 8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was being confessed by Daniel himself! What extraordinary humility and solidarity to stand with his wayward cousins and confess their sins as his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How was he able to do this‚∏∫something at which we ourselves often fail? I think it was because his gaze was heavenward and his eyes were fixed on the Lord that he was so aware of his own sinfulness and so uninterested in self-justification or comparisons with others. And so he simply stood alongside them. He was truly humble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;rsquo;s confession continues at length. Remarkably, his cry for mercy was not for his own sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúO Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. O Lord, pay attention and act. Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/daniel&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Daniel 9:19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;rsquo;s greatest concern was that the Lord himself was dishonoured by the shame his people bore. It&amp;rsquo;s not that he had low self esteem. By no means! He simply spent no time thinking about himself. Truly he was humble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so he was received by the Lord with kindness and love, and visited by the angel Gabriel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, ‚ÄúO Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding. At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/daniel&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Daniel 9:22-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would do well to follow Daniel&amp;rsquo;s example in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/micah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Micah 6:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow Daniel&amp;rsquo;s example, Amy, and walk humbly with your God, knowing that you are greatly loved! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A city on a hill</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/a-city-on-a-hill/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 08:30:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/a-city-on-a-hill/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/a-city-on-a-hill/gabriele-merlino-photographer-bnvubGJTyNg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A city on a hill" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we shine for Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jesus‚∏∫that&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing. Consider what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. Let your light so shine before others that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:14-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is the pivotal word here? The answer is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;, but it is not all that clear. To be sure, this is the alternative translation given in the footnote in the ESV. The mainline translation is like the NIV rendering, neither of which are particularly helpful: &lt;em&gt;In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this phrasing obscures what really matters. At times like this I turn to the NASB, the most literal translation of them all, the one that remains closest to the original language. Here&amp;rsquo;s what we find there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:16 (NASB)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see? &lt;em&gt;In such a way that they &amp;hellip; glorify your Father who is in heaven&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a way. That is how we must shine, for there are two strikingly different ways shining ones could be received. ‚ÄúOh wow, Simon is amazing, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?‚Äù Or, ‚Äúoh wow, have you noticed the transforming grace at work in Simon&amp;rsquo;s life? The Lord is amazing, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ego craves one of these but it is the other that glorifies the Lord. I must confess and repent and shine in such a way that they glorify my Heavenly Father. All the glory must go to him. That must be my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire, and so I must die to self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, the Apostle Paul focuses on the main point with exceeding clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For God, who said, ‚ÄúLet light shine out of darkness,‚Äù has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/2-corinthians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Corinthians 4:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am merely a clay jar, really nothing to behold at all, quite unimpressive and weak and somewhat vulnerable, but oh my, the treasure that I have within! The treasure that Jesus my Saviour has given me, that the Holy Spirit living in me is guarding and growing. The treasure that others must see as I live my life as a city on a hill. The treasure that will attract those outside the Kingdom to come in, and the treasure that will encourage my brothers and sisters in Christ to live lives that are ever more characterised by love and holiness. On dying to self, I find incredible joy in this city on a hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let your light shine in such a way, Amy, that they glorify your Father who is in heaven! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The poor in spirit</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-poor-in-spirit/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 06:25:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-poor-in-spirit/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-poor-in-spirit/jackson-david-2hJZF52UR9k-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The poor in spirit" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it that is so remarkable about the blessing for the poor in spirit, the first thing Jesus said in The Sermon on the Mount, almost the very first thing he was recorded as saying publicly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to what is so remarkable here, let&amp;rsquo;s first unpack what it means to be poor in spirit, because poor in spirit doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound very blessed does it? Psalm 63 will help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 63:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction to the psalm tells us that David wrote this when he was in the wilderness of Judah. The physical thirst experienced in that arid land parallelled the spiritual thirst of his being poor in spirit, being so aware of his need of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t think for a moment that there is any lack of desire for God among the poor in spirit, or any lack of understanding of his goodness and mercy. The truth is the complete opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 63:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s steadfast love is better than life itself. There is full understanding here, along with the most desperate longing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands. My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips, when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night; for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 63:4-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things we must notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, his life is hard‚∏∫so very hard. There is steadfast determination to praise, to trust, to honour the Lord, right alongside the sleeplessness. That&amp;rsquo;s right. In the watches of the night, in the time for sleeping, sleep does not come. So the psalmist meditates on the Lord, on his goodness and kindness and faithfulness, and so must we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And secondly, the blessing and satisfaction in the Lord which is so painfully longed for is in the future. It is not yet. My soul will be satisfied. I will sing for joy. There is both trust and determination here. But it is not yet. The joy is to come. And in the meantime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 63:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are both in the present tense, right here, right now. My Heavenly Father upholds me with his right hand in the longing and the sleeplessness, and my soul clings to him. I am poor in spirit, so very aware of my need for him, and he honours that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we can understand what is so remarkable about the blessing for the poor in spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a present tense blessing, almost uniquely amidst the others (they shall be comforted; they shall inherit the earth; they shall be satisfied; they shall receive mercy; they shall see God; they shall be called sons and daughters of God ‚Äî Matthew 5:4-9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theirs is the kingdom of heaven, right now. There is nothing to wait for. There is nothing held back. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessed are the poor in spirit, Amy, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reciprocity</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/reciprocity/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 06:15:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/reciprocity/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/reciprocity/duy-pham-Cecb0_8Hx-o-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Reciprocity" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the principle of reciprocity in relationship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you‚∏∫that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other&amp;rsquo;s faith, both yours and mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 1:11-12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote these words to the Christians in Rome before he ever met them. Marvel at the warmth in his longing to see them, his desire to bless, and that they might share &lt;em&gt;mutual encouragement&lt;/em&gt;, each to the other, even on meeting for the first time. Such is the love a Christian has for their brothers and sisters in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now those on the DCBC youth mission trip will be with you, and some of these you may be meeting for the first time: Abigail, Alexia, Blake, Emma, Hannah, Jack, Zac, Taylor, and Aria (although I notice that one of these you have known for her whole life!). We have been praying for safety and travelling mercies and the richest of blessings, lifting you and them both up before our loving Heavenly Father. Now be encouraged, each to the other, by each other&amp;rsquo;s faith and every spiritual blessing in Christ. And have some fun together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reciprocity is about giving and receiving simultaneously, imparting blessing and being blessed, symmetrically and joyously together. Every relationship is deepened by this: husband and wife, parent and child, teacher and student, boss and employee, and most especially brother and sister in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul knew this, and even as he desired to bring blessing and teaching to those new Christians in Rome, he was anticipating receiving blessing and encouragement in return. The huge difference in maturity and degree of experience simply did not matter. How joyous is genuine Christian fellowship!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Christians come together, however, there is a potential barrier to such reciprocity in relationship, namely one taking the superior position, looking down on the other as somehow poorer or otherwise less than, to be solely the recipient rather than also the source of blessing. Let&amp;rsquo;s remind ourselves how Paul regarded Timothy to see how to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy was indeed young to be in Christian leadership, perhaps in his late 20s or early 30s, and there was a huge gulf between their levels of experience and capability. Paul was much older, was so much more highly educated, and ended up writing more than half of the New Testament, but see how highly he regarded Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. But you know Timothy&amp;rsquo;s proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 2:20-22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his charge to Timothy himself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-timothy&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Timothy 4:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish, I cannot help myself from giving you the mathematical definition of a reciprocal: of a quantity or function, related to another so that their product is unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be one, Amy, with your younger brothers and sisters in Christ, and may you bring blessing and encouragement each to the other! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The tar pit</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-tar-pit/krystian-piatek-JUqXOPOYXEg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The tar pit" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever chosen to take the opposite view than the one you would naturally hold, and found insight? Let&amp;rsquo;s do that now. Let me commend to you the Pharisee, and let us find much to admire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this so hard? We have learned for the longest time to despise the Pharisees. I mean, they&amp;rsquo;re the baddies, right? Well let&amp;rsquo;s put that to one side for now. Jesus said of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:20&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly Paul appealed to the Philippians about his own impeccable standards as a Pharisee (Philippians 3:4-6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees were nothing if not serious about honouring the Lord, putting many of us to shame with the level of discipline with which they lived their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as I strive to live a right life, exercising all of my discipline to honour the Lord, how do I see myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would do well to consider this parable of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTwo men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed about himself: &amp;lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other men‚∏∫robbers, evildoers, adulterers‚∏∫or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBut the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &amp;lsquo;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:10-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I observe someone struggling in life, am I tempted to think, I&amp;rsquo;m not like them?  And am I pleased not to be so?  Are you tempted to think likewise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despising the Pharisee prevents me from seeing the truth, which is in fact, such am I. No different from the one I disdain. No better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no difference &amp;hellip; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 3:22-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find I am in truth stuck in the tar pit of self-righteousness with my Pharisaical heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God‚∏∫through Jesus Christ our Lord!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 7:24-25a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing my eyes on Jesus I cry out, Lord, I repent of my Pharisaical heart. Have mercy on me, a sinner. Rescue me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honour the Lord with your whole heart, with your whole life, Amy, and cry out to him, Lord, have mercy on me! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sacrifice</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/sacrifice/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 06:25:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/sacrifice/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/sacrifice/Crucifixus.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Sacrifice" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the turning point in the Easter story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact there are two. We&amp;rsquo;ll come to the joyous second, but let&amp;rsquo;s not rush that. Now is the time to contemplate the mournful first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading Mark&amp;rsquo;s account of the last days of Jesus&amp;rsquo; life, from the triumphal entry into Jerusalem up until his death on the cross (Mark 11-15). There&amp;rsquo;s much that happens, starting with Jesus clearing the temple, which had become a den of robbers. We see Jesus speaking and acting with power and authority. Until we don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turning point is signalled when Jesus is before the high priest, being interrogated. Being accused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 14:61&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven&amp;rsquo;t you wondered about that? In fact Mark records here only one statement from Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again the high priest asked him, ‚ÄúAre you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI am,‚Äù said Jesus. ‚ÄúAnd you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 14:61-62&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark records Jesus speaking only once more, confirming Pilate&amp;rsquo;s description of him, in his words as the king of the Jews. And after this, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the turning point, over which I have been weeping. After confirming that he is indeed the Lord of all creation, from here on Jesus is no longer the one who does anything at all. Having given up all the power and authority which are his by right, he is now simply one who is done to. He makes himself nothing but the object of others&amp;rsquo; actions, completely and absolutely surrendered to their will, to the Father&amp;rsquo;s will, like a lamb to the slaughter. And we read a factual, brutal account of what was done to him, culminating in this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means ‚Äúthe place of the skull‚Äù).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they crucified him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 15:22, 24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord of all creation, humiliated. Pierced. Crushed. Extinguished. The object of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath. But let us be clear about what was happening. Just before he died, Jesus cried out in anguish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/mark&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 15:34&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the answer to this. You know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel, Amy, even in the weeping, at that answer which is the Father&amp;rsquo;s great love for you! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Taking offence</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/taking-offence/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/taking-offence/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/taking-offence/martin-olsen-szfPB4X-FWk-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Taking offence" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the world&amp;rsquo;s favourite pastime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it that people love to do? That the whole media machine is geared up to deliver? At which society has become so very accomplished? Here&amp;rsquo;s what: &lt;em&gt;taking offence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking offence‚∏∫human nature delights in it, Christians too at times, sadly. We love to be outraged. It is almost tribal. People bond over it, which means that people also divide over it, for there is always a source of the offence, and that source is surely a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan has a field day with this‚∏∫oh how he uses it! What is to be done? Two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize it for what it is. Offence-taking is not of the Lord. In these days in which we live perhaps it is one of Satan&amp;rsquo;s most potent weapons to bring division in the world, and even between the people of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live differently. Paul tells us how, and we only just considered this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 4:1-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearing with one another in love is the key. This is the opposite of offence-taking. What does it look like, this bearing with one another, in love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bear with someone means to be patient, to be tolerant. We are all imperfect, and sometimes we say things that could be misconstrued. Let us receive one another with humility, gentleness and patience, bearing with one another in love. May generous hearts enable us to navigate with wisdom and kindness those pinch points at which offence could so easily be taken. The Lord is glorified as we do, for it is in his Spirit that we are able to do this. Bearing with one another in love is powerfully and relationally healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live like this, Amy, and know the joy of the Lord in keeping the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A life worthy of our calling</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/a-life-worthy-of-our-calling/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/a-life-worthy-of-our-calling/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/a-life-worthy-of-our-calling/vidar-nordli-mathisen-K4c8RymNeu8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A life worthy of our calling" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How important is it to read a verse in context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul writes this to the Ephesians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 4:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to live such a life! What exactly should I do then? Er &amp;hellip; live honourably, behave well, be kind to strangers, help old ladies across the street? Is this what Paul means? Notice how we bring so much of our own context to understanding a verse. The only way to know is to read the verse in &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; context. So what is the context here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 4:1-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the immediate context. The wider context is the whole letter. Paul was writing this letter from Rome, where he was confined ‚Äúfor the Lord‚Äù (Acts 28). Notice what he went through in serving the one he loved, and how much humility he demonstrated, giving up his very freedom for the sake of the ones for whom he was sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading on, we can understand what his urging means, what is this worthy life to be lived. It is a life of humility, a life to be lived in community with others. None of these attributes can be outworked on our own: humility, gentleness, bearing with one another in love, keeping unity. And note that Paul was able to write with such credibility (‚Äúthen‚Äù) because of the testimony of his own life, his own humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word worthy here means &lt;em&gt;appropriate&lt;/em&gt;. So they, and we, are urged to live a life appropriate to the calling we have received. What is this calling, this invitation? And why is a life of humility the appropriate response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚∏∫and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚∏∫not by works, so that no-one can boast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us has been rescued by grace alone, with no merit on our part. The rescue was undeserved and there is no room for boasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Later in the chapter, Paul goes on to other aspects of living a worthy life. Humility by itself is not enough, of course. But that is a subject for another day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live a life worthy of the calling you have received, Amy, now you know where that begins! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Relational authenticity</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/relational-authenticity/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 06:30:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/relational-authenticity/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/relational-authenticity/jingming-pan-iYsrkq5qq0Q-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Relational authenticity" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the most important thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fruit of the Spirit is love &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/galatians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve left this one until last, precisely because it is the most important. Why do I say that? So many reasons, starting with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus replied: ‚Äú&amp;lsquo;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&amp;rsquo;  This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: &amp;lsquo;Love your neighbour as yourself.&amp;rsquo;  All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 22:36-40&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 13:34-35&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not optional‚∏∫there is absolutely no wriggle room here! And yet, why is it that we do not live like this? For tragically, we do not. We should be living and breathing this, all the time. Nothing matters more. But what exactly are we supposed to do as we go about our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phrase I came upon recently has really got its hooks into me: &lt;em&gt;relational authenticity&lt;/em&gt;. This is surely the starting point. Relational authenticity recognises that the one standing before me is a real person, whoever they may be. A real person with their hopes, dreams, disappointments and hurts, just like me. And the choice which is uniquely mine is whether and how to relate, to accept, to love. How do I regard them? As background noise? A diversion? A duty? Someone to look down upon? Someone to avoid? Or a whole person, with all their value and complexity and brokenness, loved by the Lord, as am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s more. Relational authenticity demands radical humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no difference &amp;hellip; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 3:22-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How this challenges ego!  But could we live like this? The prize is glorious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 2:21-22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we develop relational authenticity, this is what we will find: all of us, together, a holy temple in the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not overlook that this is the fruit of the Spirit. We grow in this as the Lord does his work of transforming grace in our lives. In my life. In yours. Softening our hearts, enabling us to love, and making us more like Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursue relational authenticity, Amy, and learn to love like Jesus, the most important thing! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The thorn in Paul&#39;s flesh</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-thorn-in-pauls-flesh/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 06:24:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-thorn-in-pauls-flesh/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-thorn-in-pauls-flesh/jacqueline-day-krUUaZ4GvHk-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The thorn in Paul&#39;s flesh" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What exactly was Paul&amp;rsquo;s thorn anyway, and why does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been much speculation about the nature of Paul&amp;rsquo;s thorn in the flesh (2¬†Cor¬†12:7-9), and of course we do not know.  Personally, I doubt it was any disability, of speech or of stature, nor any severe pain to endure. Rather I suspect it was something utterly shameful and humiliating, perhaps something in his own character. Something internal and deeply personal. Why do I think this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every other respect, Paul was the elite. Highly educated. Highly disciplined. Highly capable. Zealous. Purging every sin and making every effort to live a right life (Acts¬†22:3, Phil¬†3:4-6). These are not attributes that lead to humility! They are more likely to lead to arrogance, to smug self-satisfaction, to a sense of moral superiority. How can such a one be depending completely on the Lord, and be of any use in the Kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul rather was able to live with so much humility and dependence on the Lord &lt;em&gt;because of this&lt;/em&gt; (‚Äúin order to keep me from becoming conceited‚Äù, 2¬†Cor¬†12:7), being able to say, ‚ÄúChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners‚∏∫of whom I am the worst‚Äù (1¬†Tim¬†1:15). And to live with boldness. Such boldness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the shame of my past comes back to haunt me, to crush me, I do not deny it. I must not. The Lord lifts me, welcomes me, saves me, accepts me. Oh how I need him! I am not condemned. But in the rescue and the redemption, all pride is gone. My grateful heart loves the Lord, and seeks to honour him. And so I can live with levels of humility, gentleness and compassion which eluded me previously. The Lord is glorified, and I am diminished. I can die to self, and live for him, holding nothing back. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice in the rescue, Amy, whatever form it takes! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On being vulnerable</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/on-being-vulnerable/vitaliy-zalishchyker-3Ank_q_qVtE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post On being vulnerable" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so important to be vulnerable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our every instinct is to protect and defend, to justify ourselves, and yet we must not do it!  Why is this?  Paul wrote to the Corinthians about his vision and the thorn in his flesh, concluding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lord said to me, ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ‚Äôs power may rest on me &amp;hellip; I delight in weaknesses &amp;hellip; for when I am weak, then I am strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/2-corinthians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Corinthians 12:9, 10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am judged, even when the judgment is as ignorant as it is harsh, I choose not to defend myself. How easy is it to do this? It is the hardest thing! It is dying to self. (But, my integrity is not defined by what others think of me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation is the idol of our age, both within and without the church, maybe the greatest barrier to the gospel, to the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, and to us honouring the Lord with our whole lives. Here are the four most oppressive words, that empty us of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s power and make us utterly useless for him: &lt;em&gt;what will they think?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will they think of me? I choose not to care! And here is the reason to be vulnerable, to not care about this. Suddenly I can share the gospel with great power, and absolute confidence. I am invincible, because what defines me is unassailable! (2¬†Cor¬†5:17, Col¬†3:3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúLet me reach down from my pedestal of perfection and set you on the right path, O hapless misguided sinner.‚Äù No! No! No! A hundred times no! That is the way of the Pharisee, and the Lord is not in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, ‚ÄúLet me tell you of the one who rescued me‚Äù, risking the contemptuous, sneering reply, ‚ÄúWhat? Did you need to be rescued?‚Äù Yes, I did. I was rescued, am being rescued, will be rescued. It is ongoing, and I am unashamed. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be vulnerable and unashamed, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Pharisaical heart</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-pharisaical-heart/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-pharisaical-heart/tamara-gore-P4mxBJtINCw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Pharisaical heart" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What breaks our Father&amp;rsquo;s heart? That would be a long list to be sure. I&amp;rsquo;ll pick one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I got to see Les Mis√©rables at the Regent. What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad‚∏∫I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears. The saddest song? Some would say I Dreamed a Dream, and that is indeed crushing (‚Äúnow life has killed the dream I dreamed‚Äù), or On My Own, √âponine&amp;rsquo;s song of unrequited love for Marius (‚Äúthe trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers‚Äù). But there is another: Javert&amp;rsquo;s soliloquy, Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javert is the policeman who pursues the protagonist Jean Valjean through the decades, after he breaks parole from a 19 year sentence of slavery for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Valjean receives unexpected grace and repents (‚ÄúI feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?‚Äù). Thus he begins a sacrificial life of love, but Javert cannot accept this. Stars is his vow to pursue Valjean and never rest until he is again behind bars. He sings, ‚Äúmine is the way of the Lord‚Äù (he is so wrong), and ‚Äúthose who falter and those who fall must pay the price‚Äù (wrong again, Javert ‚Äî Rom¬†8:1-4, 31-39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An isolated sad event cannot be a tragedy, no matter how heart-rending, as explained by Educating Rita&amp;rsquo;s teacher. Rather, a tragedy is the long and apparently inescapable trajectory of a life, set in motion by a particular course of events or an attitude of the heart, leading inexorably to one&amp;rsquo;s own destruction. It is the prolonged inevitability which makes it so. Javert eventually takes his own life, the only possible consequence given his Pharisaical heart, hardened over so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many today live Javert&amp;rsquo;s life, bereft of grace. Each one is a tragedy, and each one breaks our Father&amp;rsquo;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love with the Father&amp;rsquo;s love, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who am I?</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/who-am-i/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 06:48:00 +1200</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/who-am-i/spencer-tamichi-bjH4uE6iuEo-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Who am I?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a vital question that is for any of us. It could take some time to answer! In fact, I have had to revisit it myself in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most valiant attempt I know of to grapple with this is by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor who was imprisoned in Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp by the Nazis during World War II. He was executed just one month before the end of the war. One month! He wrote the following while incarcerated. Notice that someone we might regard as a giant in the faith did not regard himself like that at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Am I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? They often tell me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I stepped from my cell&amp;rsquo;s confinement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Calmly, cheerfully, firmly,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Like a squire from his country house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? They often tell me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I used to speak to my warders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Freely and friendly and clearly,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;As though it were mine to command.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? They also tell me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I bore the days of misfortune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Equably, smilingly, proudly,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;like one accustomed to win.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I then really that which other men tell of?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Or am I only what I myself know of myself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Restless and longing and sick, like a bird in a cage,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Struggling for breath, as though hands were compressing my throat,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yearning for colours, for flowers, for the voices of birds,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Thirsting for words of kindness, for neighbourliness,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tossing in expectations of great events,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Powerlessly trembling for friends at an infinite distance,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Weary and empty at praying, at thinking, at making,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Faint, and ready to say farewell to it all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? This or the other?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Am I one person today and tomorrow another?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Am I both at once? A hypocrite before others,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And before myself a contemptible woebegone weakling?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Or is something within me still like a beaten army&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fleeing in disorder from victory already achieved?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who am I? They mock me, these lonely questions of mine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Whoever I am, Thou knowest, O God, I am thine!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What courageously honest words, from someone facing the ultimate test of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that you are his, Amy, while you continue to work out the rest üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/he-guides-the-humble-in-what-is-right/claudio-carrozzo-fCtvc5eFcqk-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post He guides the humble in what is right" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of verses from Psalm 25 for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways. He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 25:8-9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the therefore. Meditate on it. Revel in it. See how the Lord desires for us to be holy and blameless, and yet he does not wait for that to be so, to instruct us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path of humility is more than these two verses. It is the whole psalm. And now, I have given you one of my most precious jewels. üôè&lt;/p&gt;
