      <description>Dear Amy,
Who am I?
What a vital question that is for any of us. It could take some time to answer! In fact, I have had to revisit it myself in recent years.
The most valiant attempt I know of to grapple with this is by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor who was imprisoned in Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp by the Nazis during World War II. He was executed just one month before the end of the war.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
Here is Psalm 25:8-9 for you: Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways. He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.
Notice the therefore. Meditate on it. Revel in it. See how the Lord desires for us to be holy and blameless, and yet he does not wait for that to be so, to instruct us.
The path of humility is more than these two verses.</description>
