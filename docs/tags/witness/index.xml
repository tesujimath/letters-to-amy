      <description>Dear Amy,
Apparently we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, and this is a reason to run the race with perseverance. What&amp;rsquo;s all that about?!
 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
â€• Hebrews 12:1 It&amp;rsquo;s important that we understand this, because doesn&amp;rsquo;t it sound just a little bit creepy?</description>
