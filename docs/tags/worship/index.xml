        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/love-and-holiness/kanchanara-7E3QGntO66M-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Love and holiness" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If love is one side of the coin which defines how we must live our lives, what is the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the coin bears the face of Jesus, for it is his currency and our lives must reflect his own. So why is it that I am wanting to further distil this? Simply so we may grasp with crystal clarity what it really means to live our lives in a way which honours him absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already seen that love is the most important thing‚∏∫love for the Father and love for Jesus, followed by love for one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, ‚ÄúWhich commandment is the most important of all?‚Äù Jesus answered, ‚ÄúThe most important is, ‚ÄòHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.‚Äô The second is this: ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbour as yourself.‚Äô There is no other commandment greater than these.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark 12:28-31&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One side of the coin is simply inscribed &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the other side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, ‚ÄúSpeak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 19:1-2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side of the coin is inscribed &lt;em&gt;holiness&lt;/em&gt;. Love and holiness. Two sides of the same coin in fact. How so? Jesus tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIf you love me, you will keep my commandments.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 14:15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our personal holiness must be a consequence of love. Our motivation to live with holiness must be love for the Lord, our utmost desire to honour him. There is no other way to live like this victoriously in his power and by his grace. And in this there can be no pretending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnd you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Chronicles 28:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word here is &lt;em&gt;y√™tser&lt;/em&gt;, which means intent. &lt;em&gt;He understands every intent of the thoughts.&lt;/em&gt; Every motive. This is both confronting and liberating. Confronting obviously. But liberating because when we stumble, which we do because that is part of what it means to be human, he understands the motive behind the thoughts. If my deepest desire is to honour my Heavenly Father, he knows this, and my stumbles are easily forgiven as simply that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love and holiness‚∏∫this is what must define us if we are to bring him glory, fulfil his mission for us, and change the world. And this too is what must define our church if we are to have any relevance in a broken and hurting world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So each morning I awake, I resolve to honour the Lord this very day through the love and holiness of my life. It is my offering of worship to him, and it is joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursue love and holiness, Amy, with ruthless consistency and great joy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The prayers of the saints</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-prayers-of-the-saints/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 06:15:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-prayers-of-the-saints/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-prayers-of-the-saints/nathan-dumlao-k-oS0iKn0Qg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The prayers of the saints" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to all the prayers that we pray?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many prayers are prayed, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? Prayers of compassion, of kindness, of longing, of desperation, of joyful surrender. Prayers for deliverance for God&amp;rsquo;s most faithful servants. Prayers for healing. Prayers offered with tears, and prayers offered from broken hearts. Where do all these prayers go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostle John gives us a peek into the very throne room of heaven. Look what we find there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 5:6-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in these golden bowls of incense are the prayers of the saints. Our prayers. That&amp;rsquo;s right, those prayers we pray which please the Lord are kept in golden bowls in the throne room of heaven, held by the twenty-four elders. And then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 8:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These prayers are a fragrant offering to the Lord on the golden altar before his very throne! A gift of worship from the saints to the one we adore. Our prayers. Our gift of worship. May my prayers so please the Lord that he keep them in a golden bowl for that day. Your prayers too, Amy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not the end of the matter. Look what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 8:5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many prayers seem not to be answered, but they are certainly not overlooked. There is a day coming, a terrifying day, when the judgment of God will finally be unleashed on all the earth, when his justice will finally be done and all his faithful ones will finally be delivered. Some of our prayers will be held until that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other prayers which are not held back. Praise him for those prayers which please him to answer far more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been aware, Amy, of quite how difficult things have been for you in the classroom for the longest time, and I have been praying that this year may be radically different. That this year you and your students together may know joy in the teaching and learning experience in your classroom, and that this would be a gift from the Lord. For a good many weeks from the beginning of the year this has been my most earnest prayer for you, and I just heard that the Lord has begun to answer that prayer. Praise the Lord! And bless you, Amy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us continue to pray prayers, Amy, that are a fragrant offering of worship to the Lord, knowing that for some we will see miraculous answers now, while others are kept in golden bowls until that day! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Praise the Lord!</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/praise-the-lord/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/praise-the-lord/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/praise-the-lord/oscar-ivan-esquivel-arteaga-nY1sYUoJXYE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Praise the Lord!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should we praise the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Praise the LORD! For it is good to sing praises to our God; for he is beautiful, and a song of praise is fitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 147:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, I am quoting from the ESV alternative translation for that phrase, ‚Äúfor he is beautiful‚Äù.  The mainline translation is ‚Äúfor it is pleasant‚Äù, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to me to be such a compelling reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth looking into how Bible translation is done, what is the nature of the original language, and how it is that the translators came to the interpretations that are written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Types of textual footnotes&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî (1) Footnotes of this kind provide alternative translations for specific words or phrases when there is a strong possibility that such words or phrases could be translated in another way. &amp;hellip; In such cases, the translation deemed to have the stronger support is in the text while other possible renderings are given in the note. (2) &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ESV Bible Explanation of Features&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrew pronouns are troublesome! The word translated ‚Äúhe‚Äù is the masculine third person pronoun, but this could also mean ‚Äúit‚Äù, referring to the act of singing praises, itself a masculine noun. No wonder Bible translations differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How then do we decide on the right translation, the one that honours the Lord and is faithful to what he is saying? And why is it that the ESV translators settled on the mainline of ‚Äúfor it is pleasant‚Äù, relegating to a footnote ‚Äúfor he is beautiful‚Äù? And furthermore, how is it that I have the cheek to call them out about that as a mistake?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered two factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, what are the other occurrences of the word translated here as pleasant or beautiful, the Hebrew &lt;em&gt;n√¢‚Äõ√Æym&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This word is used 14 times in the Old Testament, and I have to admit, mostly to describe a pleasant experience (‚ÄúThe lines have fallen for me in pleasant places‚Äù ‚Äî Psalm 16:6; ‚ÄúBehold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!‚Å†‚Äù ‚Äî Psalm 133:1). Mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here I deem the second factor to carry more weight, which is, what does the rest of this psalm say? Context is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would we expect in each case? A psalm which starts off with how pleasant it is to praise the Lord could be expected to continue with and expand upon the praise experience. That&amp;rsquo;s not what happens here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, our psalm comprises an exposition of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s character, of his nature, of his deeds. It is entirely about the Lord, the beautiful one. This is why we praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of Israel.&lt;br&gt;
He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.&lt;br&gt;
He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names.&lt;br&gt;
Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure.&lt;br&gt;
The LORD lifts up the humble; he casts the wicked to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 147:2-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it continues. And it is just like this in Psalm 135, where the same Hebrew word is used. &lt;em&gt;He is beautiful (v3).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am grateful to those learned and proficient Bible translators who have made available for us the Bible in language we can understand, I am more grateful to the Lord for how he speaks to my heart through his eternal word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise the Lord, Amy, for he is beautiful! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Present tense</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/present-tense/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/present-tense/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/present-tense/GSFC_20171208_Archive_e001661_orig.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Present tense" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What difference is made by the tense of a verb?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading again John&amp;rsquo;s vision of the throne room in heaven. Just as a preliminary, let me note one thing there that always makes me smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 4:2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creator God of the universe is enthroned, high and exalted, and John is describing what he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 4:3a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jasper and carnelian? Really? Come on, John, is that all you&amp;rsquo;ve got for us? Is that the best you can do? That tells us nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it is, from which we may infer just how indescribable is the Lord. Beautiful beyond description. Holy beyond description. Good and wise and kind beyond description. Praise his holy name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald. Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads. From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God, and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 4:3b-6a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the inadequacy of the description, doesn&amp;rsquo;t this quicken the pulse and thrill our hearts?‚∏∫the awesome majesty of our great God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s what comes next that caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight. And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 4:6b-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you notice that John switched to the present tense? What he describes is happening right now! The worship in heaven is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join with them, Amy, and worship the holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come! üôèüôå&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A melody made with the heart</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/a-melody-made-with-the-heart/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 06:24:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/a-melody-made-with-the-heart/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/a-melody-made-with-the-heart/nadin-mario-pO4ZI2krY_k-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A melody made with the heart" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can our hearts make melody to the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 5:18b-19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word here translated &lt;em&gt;melody&lt;/em&gt; appears in only three other places in the New Testament. Here&amp;rsquo;s one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it is written, ‚ÄúTherefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and &lt;em&gt;sing&lt;/em&gt; to your name.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 15:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relates to one of David&amp;rsquo;s psalms of deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation‚∏∫the God who¬†&amp;hellip;  rescued me from my enemies¬†&amp;hellip;¬†.  For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing to your name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 18:46-49&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more than 30 years of reading the NIV¬†1984, I have recently switched to the ESV, a more literal translation, and I am loving both the precision and the freshness. And so I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed something here. David will sing to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that the Lord&amp;rsquo;s name is his character, his reputation, the essence of who he is and what he is like. And what is that? Moses once asked exactly this, and behold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children&amp;rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 34:5-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses&amp;rsquo; response is the only one possible‚∏∫a heart-response of worship and adoration, a song to the Creator God of the universe, to the one who loves us, who is our rescuer, our rock and our redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart is an instrument of love, and this is the melody I can make to the name of the one who loves you and me both with boundless, unfathomable love, to all that he is and all that he has done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing and make melody to the Lord with your heart, Amy, to the one who has rescued us and loves us beyond imagining! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Personal holiness</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/personal-holiness/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 06:24:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/personal-holiness/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/personal-holiness/jeffery-erhunse-4XK2oKKvzVU-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Personal holiness" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you think of another aspect of worship which has nothing to do with singing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God‚Äôs mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God‚∏∫this is your spiritual act of worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 12:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the act of worship which is personal holiness, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the most important word here: &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; links what follows to the entirety of the previous eleven chapters, which is Paul&amp;rsquo;s analysis of the wretched state of humankind without Christ, and of the magnitude and sufficiency of our rescue in Christ, God&amp;rsquo;s free and costly gift of grace to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 3:21-22, 27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response then to this gift of grace and righteousness must be to live a life of personal holiness. As I live my life, each day facing temptation, and each day surrendering my will to the sanctifying work of the Spirit, I articulate each small victory as an act of worship to my Heavenly Father who loves me and has rescued me from such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 6:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should note that God&amp;rsquo;s call to personal holiness is not to the righteous but to sinners, and we would do well to remember his call to Abraham out of the absolute mess and shame that he found himself in thirteen long years after his shabby act with Hagar. Hear the grace and love in this, right alongside the uncompromising call to holiness. Our Heavenly Father has so much love and such a high expectation for his sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 17:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in Christ can we live like this, but in him, we can! Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offer your body as a living sacrifice, Amy, holy and pleasing to God, and worship him! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My soul magnifies the Lord</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/benjamin-davies-FiZTaNTj2Ak-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post My soul magnifies the Lord" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does true worship look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the so-called worship songs we sing in church fall far short, often because there is a bit too much me in them. There are however some that emphatically do not, for example ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb‚Äù and ‚ÄúHere I Bow‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe Who is Mighty‚Äù. I want to dwell in the latter today, because its bridge in particular is the epitome of true worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now my soul magnifies the Lord&lt;br&gt;
I rejoice in the God Who saves&lt;br&gt;
I will trust His unfailing love&lt;br&gt;
I will sing His praises all my days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sovereign Grace Music, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxPvMJB--R4&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;He Who Is Mighty&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically there are three ‚ÄúI‚Äùs and two ‚Äúmy‚Äùs here, and yet this is in fact completely focused on the Lord. Singing this lifts me directly into his presence in joyous worship, losing myself in praise and awe and wonder‚∏∫this is the real thing! And the heart of it is ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is taken from Mary&amp;rsquo;s song of praise, the Magnificat, her response to her cousin Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s ‚ÄúBlessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!‚Äù after Mary&amp;rsquo;s humble acceptance of and joyful surrender to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s revelation to her (Luke 1:26-56).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just consider what Mary had gone through. The archangel had appeared to her and told her she was going to be the unmarried mother of the Son of God. On a human level, consider the shame she would face‚∏∫indeed, Joseph had in mind to break the marriage pledge quietly (Matthew 1:19). What was Mary&amp;rsquo;s response to the angel? That humble acceptance and joyful surrender:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Mary said, ‚ÄúBehold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:38&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder the angel had said to her, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.‚Äú (Luke 1:30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word translated &lt;em&gt;magnify&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;megalun≈ç&lt;/em&gt;, and is the same word translated &lt;em&gt;shown&lt;/em&gt; in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbours and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:57-58&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnifying here is that of the Lord himself making known his great mercy‚∏∫the character and person of God being revealed and made known‚∏∫and the only right response is one of praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean, ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù?  Simply that all that is within me, the very core of my being, reveals and makes known and honours the character and person of God, and is aligned in love and praise and worship and affirmation that the Lord is great and so worthy of praise. This is what we were created for by our Heavenly Father who knows us and loves us beyond understanding, and it is incomparably joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May your soul magnify the Lord, Amy, and may you rejoice in the God who saves! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two victories</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/two-victories/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/two-victories/jordan-wozniak-xP_AGmeEa6s-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Two victories" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, why am I writing to you on a Tuesday rather than a Wednesday? As you know, I like to ask the big questions, so let&amp;rsquo;s start with that! In fact, Megan and I are in Glenorchy, just about to embark on the Rees-Dart track, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be out of coverage for the next four days, and that&amp;rsquo;s the reason. With that out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the next big question. üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the first Easter victory, and how did that lead to the second?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two victories?  Yes, really!  The first victory was won on the cross, as Jesus died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jesus said, ‚ÄúIt is finished.‚Äù With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 19:30&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finished here means completed, fulfilled, accomplished. A triumphant, ‚ÄúI have done it!‚Äù This is the first victory, won at inconceivable cost, to the Son and the Father both. It is victory over sin, in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this lead to the second? Paul explains exactly how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death‚∏∫even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 2:5-11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The how is in the therefore. Jesus made himself obedient even to death on a cross, and &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name. This is the second victory, resurrection victory over death itself, in his life and ours both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how exalted is Jesus? &lt;em&gt;Every knee&lt;/em&gt; should bow, and &lt;em&gt;every tongue&lt;/em&gt; confess. Here&amp;rsquo;s John&amp;rsquo;s vision of the end of time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: ‚ÄúTo him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four living creatures said, ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù, and the elders fell down and worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 5:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall down with them, Amy,  and worship the one who is worthy to receive praise and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever! üôèüôå&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How much can we love the Lord?</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/how-much-can-we-love-the-lord/</link>

        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/how-much-can-we-love-the-lord/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/how-much-can-we-love-the-lord/aldebaran-s-uXchDIKs4qI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How much can we love the Lord?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much can we love the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in church we were invited to speak out our praise to God. Woefully, every single prayer was me and us. What self-obsession! Is there any deliverance from this? Wonderfully there is, and it&amp;rsquo;s to be found in Revelation, chapters 4 and 5. Lose yourself in that for a while. Hear a hundred million angels and every creature singing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 5:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are any thinking about themselves, even for a moment? Not remotely! They are wholly captivated by the presence of the risen Lord Jesus, his glory and his power, and his irresistible love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us be so, and love the Lord with such a love that we forget ourselves. With a love for him that is magnified as he enlarges our hearts with his own overflowing love. Let us adore the one who is ‚Äúworthy &amp;hellip; to receive glory and honour and power‚Äù (Rev¬†4:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love him, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
