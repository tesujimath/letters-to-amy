        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/personal-holiness/jeffery-erhunse-4XK2oKKvzVU-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Personal holiness" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you think of another aspect of worship which has nothing to do with singing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God‚Äôs mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God‚∏∫this is your spiritual act of worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 12:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the act of worship which is personal holiness, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the most important word here: &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; links what follows to the entirety of the previous eleven chapters, which is Paul&amp;rsquo;s analysis of the wretched state of humankind without Christ, and of the magnitude and sufficiency of our rescue in Christ, God&amp;rsquo;s free and costly gift of grace to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 3:21-22, 27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response then to this gift of grace and righteousness must be to live a life of personal holiness. As I live my life, each day facing temptation, and each day surrendering my will to the sanctifying work of the Spirit, I articulate each small victory as an act of worship to my Heavenly Father who loves me and has rescued me from such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 6:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should note that God&amp;rsquo;s call to personal holiness is not to the righteous but to sinners, and we would do well to remember his call to Abraham out of the absolute mess and shame that he found himself in thirteen long years after his shabby act with Hagar. Hear the grace and love in this, right alongside the uncompromising call to holiness. Our Heavenly Father has so much love and such a high expectation for his sons and daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 17:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in Christ can we live like this, but in him, we can! Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offer your body as a living sacrifice, Amy, holy and pleasing to God, and worship him! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My soul magnifies the Lord</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 08:55:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/benjamin-davies-FiZTaNTj2Ak-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post My soul magnifies the Lord" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does true worship look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the so-called worship songs we sing in church fall far short, often because there is a bit too much me in them. There are however some that emphatically do not, for example ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb‚Äù and ‚ÄúHere I Bow‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe Who is Mighty‚Äù. I want to dwell in the latter today, because its bridge in particular is the epitome of true worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now my soul magnifies the Lord&lt;br&gt;
I rejoice in the God Who saves&lt;br&gt;
I will trust His unfailing love&lt;br&gt;
I will sing His praises all my days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sovereign Grace Music, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxPvMJB--R4&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;He Who Is Mighty&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically there are three ‚ÄúI‚Äùs and two ‚Äúmy‚Äùs here, and yet this is in fact completely focused on the Lord. Singing this lifts me directly into his presence in joyous worship, losing myself in praise and awe and wonder‚∏∫this is the real thing! And the heart of it is ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is taken from Mary&amp;rsquo;s song of praise, the Magnificat, her response to her cousin Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s ‚ÄúBlessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!‚Äù after Mary&amp;rsquo;s humble acceptance of and joyful surrender to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s revelation to her (Luke 1:26-56).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just consider what Mary had gone through. The archangel had appeared to her and told her she was going to be the unmarried mother of the Son of God. On a human level, consider the shame she would face‚∏∫indeed, Joseph had in mind to break the marriage pledge quietly (Matthew 1:19). What was Mary&amp;rsquo;s response to the angel? That humble acceptance and joyful surrender:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Mary said, ‚ÄúBehold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:38&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder the angel had said to her, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.‚Äú (Luke 1:30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word translated magnify is &lt;em&gt;megalun≈ç&lt;/em&gt;, and is the same word translated shown in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbours and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:57-58&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnifying here is that of the Lord himself making known his great mercy‚∏∫the character and person of God being revealed and made known‚∏∫and the only right response is one of praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean, ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù?  Simply that all that is within me, the very core of my being, reveals and makes known and honours the character and person of God, and is aligned in love and praise and worship and affirmation that the Lord is great and so worthy of praise. This is what we were created for by our Heavenly Father who knows us and loves us beyond understanding, and it is incomparably joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May your soul magnify the Lord, Amy, and may you rejoice in the God who saves! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two victories</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/two-victories/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 09:11:00 +1200</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/two-victories/jordan-wozniak-xP_AGmeEa6s-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Two victories" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, why am I writing to you on a Tuesday rather than a Wednesday? As you know, I like to ask the big questions, so let&amp;rsquo;s start with that! In fact, Megan and I are in Glenorchy, just about to embark on the Rees-Dart track, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be out of coverage for the next four days, and that&amp;rsquo;s the reason. With that out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the next big question. üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the first Easter victory, and how did that lead to the second?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two victories?  Yes, really!  The first victory was won on the cross, as Jesus died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jesus said, ‚ÄúIt is finished.‚Äù With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 19:30&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finished here means completed, fulfilled, accomplished. A triumphant, ‚ÄúI have done it!‚Äù This is the first victory, won at inconceivable cost, to the Son and the Father both. It is victory over sin, in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this lead to the second? Paul explains exactly how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death‚Äîeven death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 2:5-11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The how is in the therefore. Jesus made himself obedient even to death on a cross, and &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name. This is the second victory, resurrection victory over death itself, in his life and ours both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how exalted is Jesus? &lt;em&gt;Every knee&lt;/em&gt; should bow, and &lt;em&gt;every tongue&lt;/em&gt; confess. Here&amp;rsquo;s John&amp;rsquo;s vision of the end of time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: ‚ÄúTo him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four living creatures said, ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù, and the elders fell down and worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 5:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall down with them, Amy,  and worship the one who is worthy to receive praise and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever! üôèüôå&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How much can we love the Lord?</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/how-much-can-we-love-the-lord/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/how-much-can-we-love-the-lord/aldebaran-s-uXchDIKs4qI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How much can we love the Lord?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much can we love the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in church we were invited to speak out our praise to God. Woefully, every single prayer was me and us. What self-obsession! Is there any deliverance from this? Wonderfully there is, and it&amp;rsquo;s to be found in Revelation, chapters 4 and 5. Lose yourself in that for a while. Hear a hundred million angels and every creature singing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and praise!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Revelation 5:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are any thinking about themselves, even for a moment? Not remotely! They are wholly captivated by the presence of the risen Lord Jesus, his glory and his power, and his irresistible love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us be so, and love the Lord with such a love that we forget ourselves. With a love for him that is magnified as he enlarges our hearts with his own overflowing love. Let us adore the one who is ‚Äúworthy &amp;hellip; to receive glory and honour and power‚Äù (Rev¬†4:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love him, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
