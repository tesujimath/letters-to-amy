      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we be completely confident in surrendering to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s will? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we retain some level of control? What might he do in our lives, by the Holy Spirit unleashed with power and authority? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it just all too scary?
Let me ask a different question which may provide some insight. If I invite the Spirit into my situation, into my life, how can I be sure he will do what I am hoping for?</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we know the will of the Lord? Let&amp;rsquo;s look again into the treasure trove which is Psalm 25.
Who, then, are those who fear the LORD? He will instruct them in the ways he chooses (v12). The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them (v14).
Tim Keller defines the fear of the Lord as this, in a sermon from Proverbs on the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom.</description>
