      <description>Dear Amy,
What exactly was Paul&amp;rsquo;s thorn anyway, and why does it matter?
There has been much speculation about the nature of Paul&amp;rsquo;s thorn in the flesh (2 Cor 12:7-9), and of course we do not know. Personally, I doubt it was any disability, of speech or of stature, nor any severe pain to endure. Rather I suspect it was something utterly shameful and humiliating, perhaps something in his own character.</description>
