      <description>Dear Amy,
Who am I?
What a vital question that is for any of us. It could take some time to answer! In fact, I have had to revisit it myself in recent years.
The most valiant attempt I know of to grapple with this is by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor who was imprisoned in Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp by the Nazis during World War II. He was executed just one month before the end of the war.</description>
