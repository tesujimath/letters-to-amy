&lt;p&gt;Have you ever chosen to take the opposite view than the one you would naturally hold, and found insight? Let&amp;rsquo;s do that now. Let me commend to you the Pharisee, and let us find much to admire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this so hard? We have learned for the longest time to despise the Pharisees. I mean, they&amp;rsquo;re the baddies, right? Well let&amp;rsquo;s put that to one side for now. Jesus said of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:20&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly Paul appealed to the Philippians about his own impeccable standards as a Pharisee (Philippians 3:4-6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees were nothing if not serious about honouring the Lord, putting many of us to shame with the level of discipline with which they lived their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as I strive to live a right life, exercising all of my discipline to honour the Lord, how do I see myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would do well to consider this parable of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed about himself: &amp;lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &amp;lsquo;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:10-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I observe someone struggling in life, am I tempted to think, I&amp;rsquo;m not like them?  And am I pleased not to be so?  Are you tempted to think likewise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despising the Pharisee prevents me from seeing the truth, which is in fact, such am I. No different from the one I disdain. No better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no difference &amp;hellip; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 3:22-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find I am in truth stuck in the tar pit of self-righteousness with my Pharisaical heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 7:24-25a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing my eyes on Jesus I cry out, Lord, I repent of my Pharisaical heart. Have mercy on me, a sinner. Rescue me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honour the Lord with your whole heart, with your whole life, Amy, and cry out to him, Lord, have mercy on me! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Pharisaical heart</title>

&lt;p&gt;What breaks our Father&amp;rsquo;s heart? That would be a long list to be sure. I&amp;rsquo;ll pick one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I got to see Les Misérables at the Regent. What a tremendous story of redemption, the power of love flowing through a redeemed life, and the triumph of love over adversity. But also so very sad — I was grateful for the darkness in the theatre, so no-one could see my tears. The saddest song? Some would say I Dreamed a Dream, and that is indeed crushing (“now life has killed the dream I dreamed”), or On My Own, Éponine&amp;rsquo;s song of unrequited love for Marius (“the trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers”). But there is another: Javert&amp;rsquo;s soliloquy, Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javert is the policeman who pursues the protagonist Jean Valjean through the decades, after he breaks parole from a 19 year sentence of slavery for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Valjean receives unexpected grace and repents (“I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul. How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?”). Thus he begins a sacrificial life of love, but Javert cannot accept this. Stars is his vow to pursue Valjean and never rest until he is again behind bars. He sings, “mine is the way of the Lord” (he is so wrong), and “those who falter and those who fall must pay the price” (wrong again, Javert — Rom 8:1-4, 31-39).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An isolated sad event cannot be a tragedy, no matter how heart-rending, as explained by Educating Rita&amp;rsquo;s teacher. Rather, a tragedy is the long and apparently inescapable trajectory of a life, set in motion by a particular course of events or an attitude of the heart, leading inexorably to one&amp;rsquo;s own destruction. It is the prolonged inevitability which makes it so. Javert eventually takes his own life, the only possible consequence given his Pharisaical heart, hardened over so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many today live Javert&amp;rsquo;s life, bereft of grace. Each one is a tragedy, and each one breaks our Father&amp;rsquo;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love with the Father&amp;rsquo;s love, Amy! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
