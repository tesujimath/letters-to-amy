      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we relate to our Heavenly Father when he leaves our most earnest and desperate prayers unanswered?
 [Jesus said] “Ask and it will be given to you &amp;hellip; how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!” (Matthew 7:7, 11)
“You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.” (John 14:14)
 But unanswered prayer is a real thing.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
Why is life so hard?
Consider: the young person, to whom life seems so bleak they turn to self harm to try to anchor to reality; the older person who lives alone, who may go days without speaking with another, having long forgotten what it&amp;rsquo;s like to give and receive a hug; the faithful believer waiting on the Lord for the fulfillment of a promise, praising him in the heart-breaking years of waiting, or the one crying out for healing and enduring debilitating pain in the waiting and the praising; the grief in the death of a child.</description>
