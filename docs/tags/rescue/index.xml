      <description>Dear Amy,
How many times will the Lord rescue? Isn&amp;rsquo;t once enough?
 “Because she loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue her” (Psalm 91:14)
 To be honest, my Bible actually says this:
 “Because he loves me,” says the LORD, “I will rescue him”
 But gender is of no consequence here. What matters is this: the pronoun is singular.
Some think the only rescue is the body-and-blood-of-Christ one that saves us from our sin and brings us into relationship with our Heavenly Father, but that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning.</description>
