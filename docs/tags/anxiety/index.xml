&lt;p&gt;Where does anxiety come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is so perniciously faith-destroying. If we are not careful we can find ourselves dwelling in imagined futures of dissatisfaction and disappointment, dragged down into doubting the goodness and faithfulness of God, into that awful place of asking in consternation: does he even care about me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this happen and where does it come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this let&amp;rsquo;s consider that question which is so often asked out of uncertainty: “What if?”⸺the question from which anxiety is crystallised. It may start with something specific, but quickly leads to more general fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if all that I hope for comes to nothing, leaving only disappointment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if my future is only shattered dreams and heartbreak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if failure and shame prevail over the rest of my life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we vanquish such spiritually disembowelling questions? We must, for Jesus commanded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not be anxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 6:25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are I think three things that we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly we have to own the question. Let&amp;rsquo;s ask a different “what if?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if Jesus is faithful and true? (Revelation 19:11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if all the Lord&amp;rsquo;s ways are steadfast love and faithfulness? (Psalm 25:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if he always keeps his promises? (Joshua 23:14, Hebrews 10:23, Numbers 23:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if there&amp;rsquo;s nothing he won&amp;rsquo;t do for his beloved sons and daughters? (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight? (Ephesians 1:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if he is transforming each one of us into the likeness of Christ? (2 Corinthians 3:18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if he will surely see this work through to completion? (Philippians 1:6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see? We can own this question in the Lord! Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we must notice the context in which Jesus gave that commandment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 6:25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore! Why therefore? Because Jesus has just been talking about treasure in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 6:21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our treasure must be in heaven. Oh what protection from anxiety we experience when we keep our treasure in that unassailable place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thirdly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 4:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our treasure may be in heaven, the Lord&amp;rsquo;s blessing is not withheld until then. How he dotes on his sons and daughters, on us, and how he lavishes his love upon us, right here and right now. We must rest in that love, thanking him, acknowledging him as the source of all that his good in our lives, bringing to him all those things that are on our minds, and receiving from him his most blessed and wonderful peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be anxious about anything, Amy! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Water into wine</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/water-into-wine/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 06:25:00 +1200</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/water-into-wine/07_FB_Wedding_Cana_1024.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Water into wine" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we miss out on the Lord&amp;rsquo;s blessing being poured out in our lives by fumbling and stumbling?  Isn&amp;rsquo;t it part of the human condition to make mistakes? But where do our mistakes leave us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re guessing that much of what follows was written yesterday morning, coinciding with the low point of your recent rollercoaster ride, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be far wrong! I am so pleased that you&amp;rsquo;ve had a personal experience of the goodness and kindness of the Lord to draw on in future, Amy, should such a thing happen again. And let me further encourage your heart with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember Jesus&amp;rsquo; first miracle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 2:1-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How presumptuous of Mary, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? Or is it simply that she knew her son, his character, and his kindness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it. When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 2:6-10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that Jesus performed miracles? To authenticate himself and his ministry, and to bring great power to his call to repentance and his invitation to enter the Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Jesus says nothing about who he is or why he has come. There is no call to repentance, and no invitation. It is as he says to his mother, “My hour has not yet come.” He has not yet started his ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did he change the water into wine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could ask a similar question of Elisha making the axe-head float (2 Kings 6:1-7). Elisha&amp;rsquo;s miracle was no great public show to refute the pagans or to demonstrate the power and authority of the Lord. It was a private little miracle done out of kindness to rescue one man from the consequences and shame of a simple mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was with Jesus. Even ahead of starting his ministry, he took pity on that wedding family who had misjudged provisioning of the wine. Embarrassment would have ensued, but not really major disaster. Nevertheless, Jesus stepped in with grace and kindness and not only undid the consequences of their mistake, but provided above and beyond, his wine being the best that was served at that celebration. Hallelujah! What a Saviour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apostle Peter understood this more than most, and for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-peter&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Peter 5:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus himself is kindness personified (Titus 3:4-5). We see this not only in the wedding wine of Cana, but also in the communion wine of the last supper, in his blood of the covenant poured out at Calvary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cast all your anxiety on him, Amy, now or at a future time, because he cares for you! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Denial</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/denial/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 06:15:00 +1200</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/denial/michael-held-g_Kde88IlvE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Denial" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the nature of Jesus&amp;rsquo; love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we journey this week towards Good Friday, towards the cross, let&amp;rsquo;s reflect on Jesus&amp;rsquo; journey towards that first Good Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had just eaten his last supper with the disciples in the upper room and washed their feet, and then said something none of them expected or wanted to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.” Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.” Jesus said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 22:31-34&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in such a familiar passage, here is something to notice afresh. Jesus refers to Peter by his pre-Christian name, Simon. Why is that? Remember that he had previously given him a new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 16:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does Jesus momentarily call him Simon here and then almost immediately Peter again? How interesting. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I think about this. The crux is not that he initially calls him Simon, but that he then calls him Peter, and this is what Jesus wants to emphasize. Even as he is foretelling his denial, Jesus is affirming him as Peter, his chosen one, Cephas the rock. Even in his denial he is still Peter. He is still Jesus&amp;rsquo; chosen one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only shortly afterwards it happened just as Jesus had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, “This man also was with him.” But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.” And a little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, “Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.” But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 22:55-60&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v61a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would have been in that look from Jesus? Disappointment surely, and sadness⸺sadness beyond imagining⸺but also love, such love. Steadfast love. Irrefutable love. The love that would send Jesus to the cross, in obedience to his Father, love even unto death. Love for Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v61b-62&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter realised he had denied the Lord who loved him, who had affirmed him, and who loved him still. And in his shame and wretchedness and humiliation he wept bitterly. At the time of crisis, when Jesus was going to his death, he, Peter, had been found not to be worthy. He was nothing but a shameful failure. How he wept over that failure, his failure to love Jesus as he loved him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us, as we approach Good Friday? Where does it leave me? What of my own denial? Anxiety that denies Jesus as Saviour. Vestigial sin that seeks to deny him as Lord. Here&amp;rsquo;s where: Jesus turns and looks at me, and he loves me. In love he stretched out his arms on that cross and died for me, and for you, Amy. I know I am not worthy of this love, but it makes no difference to Jesus. His love is irrefutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the nature of his great love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember his love for you, Amy, as we approach Good Friday, and praise him! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
