        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-goodness-of-god/simon-reza-jQhgDnovqhw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The goodness of God" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it that the living God, sovereign creator of the universe and Lord of all creation, terrifying in purity and holiness, a consuming fire, should be quite so very good and kind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had no right to expect that, did we? And yet that&amp;rsquo;s how it is. Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s just see if we can gain some insight into the astonishing goodness of God. For there is something here which may not be well understood and may in fact be slightly uncomfortable. Let the psalmist explain, as we listen in on him speaking with the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are good and do good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 119:68a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of it, acknowledging the unconditional goodness of God. It is his very nature. Now let&amp;rsquo;s consider that in the context of the rest of what the psalmist is saying. Here&amp;rsquo;s the whole stanza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have dealt well with your servant, O LORD, according to your word. Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in your commandments. Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep your word. You are good and do good; teach me your statutes. The insolent smear me with lies, but with my whole heart I keep your precepts; their heart is unfeeling like fat, but I delight in your law. It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes. The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 119:65-72&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist declares that the Lord has dealt well with him. And then we see his heartfelt cry to the Lord to teach him good judgment and knowledge. Why is this so necessary? Because as he continues we see something surprising and really quite uncomfortable. The Lord&amp;rsquo;s goodness is being outworked here through affliction. We must not fail to notice this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep your word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 119:67, 71&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And somehow this is good. How can it be good for him to be afflicted? Notice that his acknowledgement of this is in immediate juxtaposition to his assertion of the goodness of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth asking what is the nature of this affliction? We do not know what it comprises but if we look ahead we can determine its source and it is not what we might expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 119:75&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psalmist is asserting with great determination the goodness of God and his righteousness. And that it is the Lord himself who is the source of his affliction. How are we to understand this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remind ourselves of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s big picture plan for our lives, both now and especially in that time of affliction which may come, unsolicited and frankly unwelcome. But we can learn from the psalmist how we must respond to such. The psalmist&amp;rsquo;s reward is increased love for the Lord and greater understanding of his goodness and somehow an ability to keep his precepts with his whole heart. What a reward! What a gift! The gift is received through affliction and yet it is such a gift of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/jude&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jude 24-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s plans and purposes are not for our comfort and ease. Not remotely so! He has a much higher purpose, and it is for our ultimate good. If we are able to grasp this it is ultimately joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we to do in response to this understanding? Simply trust and obey and surrender our will and all of our hopes and dreams to the one who is unfathomably good and kind‚∏∫Jesus, the lover of our souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that the Lord is so very good and kind, Amy, in whatever you may be experiencing! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The next level of kindness</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-next-level-of-kindness/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-next-level-of-kindness/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-next-level-of-kindness/jukan-tateisi-bJhT_8nbUA0-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The next level of kindness" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the next level of kindness which is seen in the story of Ruth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Naomi had a relative of her husband&amp;rsquo;s, a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, ‚ÄúLet me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favour.‚Äù And she said to her, ‚ÄúGo, my daughter.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ruth&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ruth 2:1-2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where we start to see the next level of kindness, and it is the kindness of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must take care to notice what is going on here and what is not. The narrator has introduced Boaz to us but Ruth doesn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about him and neither is Naomi thinking of him at this time. The plan for Ruth and Boaz to meet is entirely of the Lord, and it is his own kindness. Let&amp;rsquo;s watch it unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So she set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers, and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ruth&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ruth 2:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that she just happened to come to that part of the field. It&amp;rsquo;s not that she went there specifically. She really didn&amp;rsquo;t know what she was doing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ruth&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ruth 2:4a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I never! How interesting! Let&amp;rsquo;s marvel at the grace and kindness and sovereignty of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just in case you&amp;rsquo;re thinking that Naomi somehow set this up &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And her mother-in-law said to her, ‚ÄúWhere did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ruth&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ruth 2:19&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She too had no idea. But all that is only half of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider Boaz. He was clearly a wealthy and powerful man, a man of means. He had both young men to work in his fields and young women under his protection. He was also a man with a noble and kind heart. But he was both single and as far as I can see childless, and quite a bit older. He had probably had to come to terms with the fact that the opportunity to have his own family had passed him by, and perhaps there was in that a sadness that he had had to learn to live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that his intentions towards Ruth were entirely honourable. He had power and influence but he was not about to wield them over this vulnerable young woman, no matter how attractive he found her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then Boaz said to Ruth, ‚ÄúNow, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ruth&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ruth 2:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw himself solely as her protector. What an honourable man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when Ruth made her move, the move planned all along by the Lord, the move anticipated by and prepared for by the Lord&amp;rsquo;s own kindness, what was his response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he said, ‚ÄúMay you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ruth&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ruth 3:10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boaz saw this as Ruth&amp;rsquo;s kindness to him, an older man, a kindness greater even than her kindness in caring for Naomi, that formerly bitter old woman. I wonder if he ever came to understand that it was first and foremost the kindness of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what was the result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ruth&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ruth 4:13, 17b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family values are passed down through the generations. How strong must have been the kindness passed on here‚∏∫not only that of Boaz and Ruth, but that of the Lord himself. Praise his holy name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one final thing to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham was the father of Isaac, and &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David the king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 1:1-2a, 5b-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly unusually in this genealogy and with great honour Ruth is mentioned as the mother. What an outcome for the kindness of a Moabite nobody, interwoven with the kindness of the Lord! Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest in the sovereignty and kindness of the Lord, Amy, for they are strong and sure! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The elephant in the room</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-elephant-in-the-room/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 06:15:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-elephant-in-the-room/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-elephant-in-the-room/atwena-goodman-PB4dNSELi_E-unsplash-cropped.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The elephant in the room" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the elephant in the room of Isaiah 6?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s vision of the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, is a glimpse into heaven itself and convicts him deeply of his own sinfulness. We should be similarly convicted. But immediately after his guilt is taken away and his sin atoned for, we find this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‚ÄúWhom shall I send, and who will go for us?‚Äù Then I said, ‚ÄúHere I am! Send me.‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúGo, and say to this people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú‚ÄòKeep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.‚Äô Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts,
and turn and be healed.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/isaiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 6:8-10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we to make of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said a similar thing to his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the disciples came and said to him, ‚ÄúWhy do you speak to them in parables?‚Äù And he answered them, ‚ÄúTo you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 13:10-14a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must understand this in the context of the verbs that the Lord uses when commanding Isaiah: make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes. This is not a passive observation of failure to understand. It is the actual cause. To them it has not been given. The Lord himself confounds the understanding of the lost, lest they turn and be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we to make of it? And how is it remotely fair?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we must not brush this aside merely because it offends our sensibilities. May we never presume so to stand in judgment on the revealed word of God. He is sovereign, not us. So we must grapple, and we must grapple in the context of what we know to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then do we know to be true? Behold God&amp;rsquo;s own description of himself, his response to Moses&amp;rsquo; request, please show me now your ways, that I may know you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children&amp;rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 34:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had no right to expect that the infinitely powerful creator God of the universe, glorious in splendour and terrifying in holiness, would be quite so good and kind. But we must not overlook that the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God (Exodus 34:14). Nor must we overlook the judgment to the third and fourth generation, nor the steadfast love to the thousandth generation, nor the orders of magnitude difference between these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately our response will be the same as Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I said, ‚ÄúHow long, O Lord?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/isaiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 6:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long, O Lord? We have grappled with this before. But here we must notice something else, even after the land has become a desolate waste, and after the burning again of the tenth that remains‚∏∫terebinth or oak, whose stump remains when it is felled: &lt;em&gt;the holy seed is its stump&lt;/em&gt; (Isaiah 6:13)‚∏∫hope remains! With God, all things are possible, and hope remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the mystery of the confounding, Amy, know that all his ways are steadfast love and faithfulness, and that hope remains! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Biblical giants</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/biblical-giants/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 06:26:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/biblical-giants/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/biblical-giants/00_29_0496_Waipoua_Forest_NZ_-_Kauri_Baum_Tane_Mahuta.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Biblical giants" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you in awe of those giants of the faith we know from the Bible‚∏∫Noah, Abraham, Moses, David‚∏∫and how they managed to play a part in the purposes of God beyond anything we see in our times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, don&amp;rsquo;t be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being righteous and blameless and the reason humankind survived God&amp;rsquo;s purge of evil by the flood, Noah was just a man, and later got himself drunk and rather embarrassed himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard. He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 9:20-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And besides being the one who in hope against all hope believed and so became the father of many nations, Abraham was previously a coward and a liar (Genesis 12:10-20) and a man who gave up waiting on the Lord (Genesis 16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses too was a coward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to him, ‚ÄúWho has made man&amp;rsquo;s mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD? Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.‚Äù But [Moses] said, ‚ÄúOh, my Lord, please send someone else.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 4:11-13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some time later, even having witnessed the Lord&amp;rsquo;s miraculous deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, Moses&amp;rsquo; lack of faith caused him to make a heinous mistake at Meribah which was most severely punished by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, ‚ÄúBecause you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/numbers&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Numbers 20:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses furthermore failed to take responsibility for this failure, and his later account to the Israelites was simply untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/deuteronomy&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Deuteronomy 3:26&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete our quartet of heroes we have David, that man after God&amp;rsquo;s own heart, that adulterer and murderer (2 Samuel 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What instead should we notice about these giants of the faith? They were all in fact frail and flawed human beings used by a mighty God for his Kingdom purposes. What was special about each of them was that God set his love upon them, and chose to work mightily through each one‚∏∫just as he does for you, and just as he does for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer to the Hebrews makes exactly this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 12:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are surrounded by these heroes. They are not above or beyond us and nor should we be in awe of them. We should rather read of their best qualities and eagerly desire those, being fully persuaded that the Lord can do the same through each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live with Noah&amp;rsquo;s blamelessness and Abraham&amp;rsquo;s faith and David&amp;rsquo;s desire for the Lord, Amy, and run with endurance, knowing that the Lord will bless you with what you desire (Psalm 37:4) and use you mightily for his Kingdom purposes! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The God of Jacob</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-god-of-jacob/fernando-paredes-murillo-Xc6gtOwSMSA-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The God of Jacob" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is your least favourite Bible character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the kings of Israel were thoroughly wicked, and Jezebel was an absolute shocker, evil beyond imagining, but for me there is one who stands out, a truly vile and revolting little man: Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob was a man without integrity. Even his name means ‚Äúhe cheats‚Äù. He manipulated his starving brother Esau to give up the birthright to him. He tricked his aging, blind father to give him the blessing that was due to Esau, lying brazenly even as he was receiving it. His household was defined by immorality and unfaithfulness, as he fathered children through each and every one of Leah, Rachel, and the two servant girls Bilhah and Zilpah. He stole Laban&amp;rsquo;s livestock through a dirty little scheme of corrupting their breeding process, after which he ran away. And years later, when Esau had graciously forgiven him and was offering an emotional reconciliation (revealing the noble heart his brother lacked) Jacob still continued with his tricks and lies. What a despicable little man he was (Genesis 25-33).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this what then happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. And God said to him, ‚ÄúYour name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.‚Äù So he called his name Israel. And God said to him, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body. The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 35:9-12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this simply astonishing? The Lord&amp;rsquo;s covenant promise to Abraham, that man of great faith, was continued through this despicable little man. Is the Lord such a terrible judge of character that he made a rather poor choice here? By no means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the key to understanding this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, ‚ÄúLet the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-corinthians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Corinthians 1:27-31&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would do well to remember this. The Lord demonstrated his sovereign power through Jacob, that despicable little man, and he continues to demonstrate it through us, in all of our foolishness and weakness and nothingness. Because of him we are in Christ Jesus. Let us boast in him, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursue love and holiness, Amy, and leave it to the Lord to work out how he will achieve his Kingdom plans and purposes! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The visit of the magi</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-visit-of-the-magi/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 08:30:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-visit-of-the-magi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-visit-of-the-magi/inbal-malca-NhlKx6Uvm3E-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The visit of the magi" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from the visit of the magi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much in this story which is noteworthy. Let&amp;rsquo;s notice afresh just three of these oddities, and see if we can understand in them something of the mystery of God&amp;rsquo;s ways, remembering that such Bible stories were not written to satisfy our curiosity nor merely for our edification. Rather they were written to bring us into relationship with our Heavenly Father and to grow us in that relationship. So, who they were, their strange gifts, and the nature of that star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, ‚ÄúWhere is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 2:1-2, 9-12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the east we don&amp;rsquo;t know where they came from‚∏∫perhaps Babylon or maybe somewhere further afield‚∏∫but we do know they weren&amp;rsquo;t Jews. They were pagans from a faraway land, nevertheless coming to worship the Son of God. Jesus was so much more than the king of the Jews. He came to save all of humankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, those strange gifts: gold for kingship, frankincense for deity, and myrrh for death. Can you imagine the conversation when they were packing? ‚ÄúHey Melchior, why are you taking myrrh? That&amp;rsquo;s for embalming dead bodies. It&amp;rsquo;s such a weird gift for a baby!‚Äù Surely he didn&amp;rsquo;t even know why myrrh was the right gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that ‚Äústar‚Äù which the magi first saw when it rose, which then seems to have disappeared on them such that they had to enter Jerusalem and ask around, where was the one they had come to worship? The result of which was, rather than quietly arriving at their precise destination, the whole of Jerusalem got to know what was happening. How interesting! As soon as that had happened, the star reappeared and guided them right to the house where Jesus was. Clearly no kind of star or celestial object then, but surely rather some angelic guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now consider, how could it all have happened like this? The Lord&amp;rsquo;s ways are so deeply mysterious and here rather opaque. He is however so fully able to achieve his plans and purposes, outworking them even through fallible individuals lacking understanding, but nevertheless bringing glory to his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 2:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank the Lord, Amy, for his wisdom, for the mystery of his ways, and for the greatest gift which is Christ the Lord, and worship him! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Joseph son of David</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/joseph-son-of-david/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 06:30:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/joseph-son-of-david/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/joseph-son-of-david/chris-curry-KsSxzBnozMY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Joseph son of David" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back‚∏∫and how lovely it was to see you face to face again after all this time! May the Lord grant you real rest over these next few weeks, and may you be revitalised and restored in his presence. ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, have you ever been surprised to notice something afresh in a very familiar Bible story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And isn&amp;rsquo;t the Bible truly amazing? I am continually finding such freshness, profound truths apparently plainly stated yet previously unnoticed or simply rediscovered. I came across one such only this week, in the oh-so-familiar Nativity story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ‚ÄúJoseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.‚Äù All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBehold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
and they shall call his name Immanuel‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(which means, God with us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 1:18-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into what I noticed, let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to be amazed once again at the whole Christmas story. I once read that of the incarnation and the resurrection, the incarnation is the greater miracle, and I am inclined to agree‚∏∫God contracted to a span, incomprehensibly made man! Praise our Lord and Saviour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what is it that I noticed afresh in this passage? Simply this: &lt;em&gt;Joseph son of David&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parentage is important in the Bible. Notice throughout that characters are introduced as so-and-so son of so-and-so. Matthew tells that Joseph&amp;rsquo;s father was Jacob, so why did the angel address him as Joseph son of David, his ancestor of a thousand years? Here&amp;rsquo;s what I take from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s rescue mission in Christ was planned from the very beginning, in his glorious promise of defeat of Satan and rescue by Christ, the Son of God, and miraculously also a descendant of the first man and the first woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LORD God said to the serpent &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI will put enmity between you and the woman,
and between your offspring and her offspring;
he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 3:14a, 15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By addressing Joseph as son of David the angel is reminding both him and us of just how long in the making has been God&amp;rsquo;s plan of rescue and redemption, and of the prophecies that foretold of the Messiah coming from David&amp;rsquo;s line. How reassuring for Joseph to know that what was happening was part of a long established plan, intricately woven from strands of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is not entirely dissimilar for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 139:13-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this, Amy, that you are loved with an ancient love, and have been from the beginning! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emptiness and exhaustion</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/emptiness-and-exhaustion/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 06:24:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/emptiness-and-exhaustion/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/emptiness-and-exhaustion/brut-carniollus-jGEsapFCLgw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Emptiness and exhaustion" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can we learn from Elijah&amp;rsquo;s faith-wobble?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was running for his life, and after 120 miles or so he left his servant and continued alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he himself went a day&amp;rsquo;s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, ‚ÄúIt is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-kings&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Kings 19:4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was a man empty and exhausted, utterly cast down, apparently at his end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, ‚ÄúArise and eat.‚Äù And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, ‚ÄúArise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.‚Äù And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-kings&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Kings 19:5-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey to Horeb was at least another 250 miles. What a cake that must have been!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice what was the Lord&amp;rsquo;s first response‚∏∫not that gentle rebuke which was to follow. The first response was practical and compassionate care and provision for his servant who was empty and utterly exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what? Elijah poured out his heart to the Lord, and you can be sure the tears were streaming down his face. Read for yourself the words of a broken man with nothing left to give, without hope and apparently all alone (1 Kings 19:10, 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what was the Lord&amp;rsquo;s response to that? He rescued him and restored him and gave him something to do (1 Kings 19:15-18). Let me paraphrase it like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt&amp;rsquo;s ok, Elijah, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this. And by the way, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. I have seven thousand others. And you are still useful to me. Come on, let&amp;rsquo;s go again.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus the Lord restored Elijah, gave him hope, and continued to work out his plans and purposes through him and through Elisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then [Elisha] arose and went after Elijah and assisted him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-kings&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Kings 19:19, 21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same God who looks with such love on each one of us in our own brokenness and emptiness and exhaustion, and rescues and restores, and continues to use us for his Kingdom plans and purposes. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His grace is sufficient for you, Amy, for his power is made perfect in your weakness! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What to pray for</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/what-to-pray-for/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 06:24:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/what-to-pray-for/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/what-to-pray-for/marcel-smits-Wt6JoSxrsvU-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What to pray for" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we know what we should pray for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a responsibility here, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? After all, Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 14:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a prayer meeting where someone was sharing a prayer request, and they seemed to take aeons to lay out every painstaking detail about their situation? Well, we can&amp;rsquo;t risk praying for the wrong thing, can we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could there be another way to see this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re surely familiar with the story of Joseph. After being sold into slavery by his brothers and thrown into prison in Egypt for a crime he didn&amp;rsquo;t commit, God raised him up to be second only to Pharaoh himself in all the land, and used him to deliver the Israelites from famine. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 47:27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some years later, however, things apparently weren&amp;rsquo;t going quite so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 2:23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this really what God had intended? Had it somehow all gone horribly wrong? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. God saw the people of Israel‚∏∫and God knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 2:24-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God knew. He didn&amp;rsquo;t need to be told. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as if he hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed what was happening to his people, his chosen ones, his beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what happened? What happened is that God met with Moses in the burning bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said, ‚ÄúI have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 3:7-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God already knew what he was going to do and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t merely to alleviate the suffering of the Israelites. He was going to bless them far beyond that, far beyond imagining, gifting to them a land flowing with milk and honey‚∏∫a land that would demonstrate his sovereign choice, his faithfulness to his covenant promise, his grace and kindness to his people, and ultimately his rescue for all of humankind. No-one was asking for this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 3:20-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply cry out to God, Amy, Lord have mercy! He already knows what to do. üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean in practice to be a people not under law but under grace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 6:14-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law and grace: are these in opposition? Jesus sets the highest standards in the Sermon on the Mount, then freely forgives and restores, refusing to let law limit grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a couple of contemporary issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-timothy&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Timothy 2:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely this was a cultural thing that no longer applies, and so surely these days women are free to pursue a preaching ministry? Surely? Except for the very next verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-timothy&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Timothy 2:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. Paul is making a creational argument here, which seems to be as clear as it is harsh. Not something that can be so easily brushed aside then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose however to hold no opinion about this, and instead I choose to honour those women who have wrestled with this themselves and are honouring and serving the Lord through a preaching ministry. Wrestling is certainly required, but who am I to seek to impose my own view into someone else&amp;rsquo;s life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, I have my own issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúBecause of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:8-9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this prevent the Lord from rescuing me from the shame of my own life after a failed marriage? Is grace trumped by law here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How tempted we are to be black and white about the lives of others, yet rather grey about our own. Show me the one who does not find themselves on the wrong side of particular verses in the Bible, and does not have to cast themselves upon God&amp;rsquo;s mercy even to live their life. Does such a one exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus himself faced a law versus grace issue in relation to the Fourth Commandment, and on one occasion when confronted by the Pharisees, he related the story of David apparently breaking the law by eating with his men consecrated bread from the temple, before concluding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI tell you, something greater than the temple is here. And if you had known what this means, &amp;lsquo;I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,&amp;rsquo; you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 12:6-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that under grace everything is in fact somewhat grey? By no means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything rather is lit by a dazzling technicolour explosion of grace and redemption from the Lord, and that particular mercy which triumphs over judgment. This enables some women to pursue a preaching ministry for his glory, some divorced men to remarry by his grace, and others to live their lives in dependence on the riches of his mercy. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that this in no way removes or diminishes our call to live as slaves to righteousness, fully surrendered and walking in obedience with the Lord. (I will undoubtedly have to revisit this aspect of ‚Äúnot under law but under grace‚Äù.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live your life for his glory, Amy, as one not under law but under grace, and praise the Lord! üôèüôå&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Uneven blessing</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/uneven-blessing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 06:24:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/uneven-blessing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/uneven-blessing/atul-pandey-0f3bZHXZSz8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Uneven blessing" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that some seem to receive more bounteous blessing from the Lord than others? How is that fair? And how is it congruent with a God of justice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with fair, and let&amp;rsquo;s be frank. What would be fair would be for each one of us to be cast into the fiery pit. And collectively, we must take responsibility through our wretched ancestors for much of the suffering of humankind, for we share the same rebellious spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBecause you have &amp;hellip; eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‚ÄòYou shall not eat of it,‚Äô cursed is the ground because of you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 3:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, and this is a wonderful, unmerited, joyous but,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a rescue! What a Saviour! Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with grateful, praising hearts, in fear and trembling, let us dare to ask again, how is it that God&amp;rsquo;s blessing is quite so unevenly distributed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul grappled with such a question in relation to the election of the Gentiles and God&amp;rsquo;s apparent rejection of the nation of Israel (Romans 9-11). That he takes three chapters over this shows us that such questions are no small matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take some of his arguments and apply them to the more general question of uneven blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God&amp;rsquo;s part? By no means! For he says to Moses, ‚ÄúI will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 9:14-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all mercy, and it is all undeserved. And let us not forget that the giver is the Creator God of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honourable use and another for dishonourable use? What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 9:21-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow in the unevenness of the blessing, God is making known the riches of his glory. Paul also shows us how to respond in the face of the apparent injustice of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brothers, my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 10:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And observe the extent of his love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 9:2-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this then the key to understanding? Even as we cry out to God over the unevenness of the blessing, is this our opportunity to learn how to truly love, and in so doing to glorify God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 25:35-36, 40&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the Lord enlarge our hearts for this broken world as we look around and see places where his blessing seems to be absent. And let us cry out to him for mercy, to the Lord, our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you think we have arrived at a place of only partial understanding, let us observe that Paul himself, the great apostle and teacher, is in just that place after three chapters of his own wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 11:33, 36&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cry out, Amy, to the one who is wise beyond understanding, and in places of meagre blessing love with his own love, from him and through him and to him, for his glory forever! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thankfulness that glorifies</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/thankfulness-that-glorifies/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 06:24:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/thankfulness-that-glorifies/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/thankfulness-that-glorifies/joshua-clay-VNjNtdu0yCw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Thankfulness that glorifies" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can our thankfulness glorify the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will praise God‚Äôs name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 69:30&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an aspect to thankfulness that I want to explore this week, which is this: receiving kindness from those around us as from the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone treats me with particular kindness, who am I likely to thank? Too often we think in purely human terms, but there&amp;rsquo;s another dimension here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s one side of the coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfil his good purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 2:13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For we are God‚Äôs handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 2:10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord has plans and purposes, and he works in and through each one of us to fulfil them. He works even in the lives of those who neither honour nor acknowledge him. We know this. Now consider the other side of that coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that the Lord delights in exercising kindness (Jeremiah 9:24)‚∏∫this is one of his good purposes! So when we receive kindness from others, why would we not make that connection and ascribe it to him? To do so makes my soul sing in gratitude to my Saviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I experienced exactly this, twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one occasion I was in church, after the morning service. Church can be the loneliest place, and I was facing the bleak prospect of a Sunday afternoon by myself, at a time when I was particularly downcast. Just outside church and completely out of the blue, a friend invited me mountain biking that afternoon, in a way that seemed so random and so kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other was on my birthday, and I was at home in a melancholic mood. Suddenly there was a knock on my back door. It was my neighbour, with a slice of apple shortcake she had just made, and a little tub of cream to go with it. How lovely. She had no idea it was my birthday, nor did I tell her. How random again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have learned that these random acts of kindness are not remotely random. I ascribe them to my Heavenly Father, and thank him. And through these he makes known his own character, his overflowing kindness, and he is glorified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise God‚Äôs name in song, Amy, and glorify him with thanksgiving! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Symphony of Life</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-symphony-of-life/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 06:31:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-symphony-of-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-symphony-of-life/jack-finnigan-aEkk0KxvPpg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Symphony of Life" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when we pray? Can we actually change the Lord&amp;rsquo;s mind? How could we possibly improve upon his already perfect plans and purposes? Why even ask for anything in prayer then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are huge questions, and I can&amp;rsquo;t possibly answer them adequately. But here&amp;rsquo;s a reflection on this, somewhat of an excursion into make-believe, which nevertheless may help to shed some light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, note that we are encouraged, nay commanded to pray, and to pray boldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; pray continually, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-thessalonians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIf you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 21:22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 14:14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine then. The Lord who created music has himself written the greatest work of all, the Symphony of Life, in 8 billion parts. He is both the composer and the conductor for its debut and only performance. It is a glorious, majestic work featuring players both unwilling and willing, with plunging depths and soaring heights, human folly and heavenly beneficence, sorrow and joy.  It is a love story, the greatest of them all, a story of rescue and redemption of a wayward people, pieced together from fragments of ruined lives made whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the billions of orchestral members play their parts with quite some improvising, the Lord hears the prayers of the saints, our prayers, and delights to weave them in to the score, making amendments and annotations with his divine pencil even as the music unfolds, taking our imperfect petitions and making them part of his perfect plans and purposes as it pleases him. And with each, smiling down on his beloved ones with such affection, like a proud father. Smiling on us, who are contributing somehow to his glorious work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel at the mystery of his ways, Amy, praising the Lord for his majesty, grace and kindness, and continue praying Kingdom prayers! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Predestination</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/predestination/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 06:45:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/predestination/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/predestination/saiph-muhammad-CSs8aiN_LkI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Predestination" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s all this about predestination? Don&amp;rsquo;t people have a right to choose for themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I swing in my hammock on that desert island, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing much to do except read Ephesians 1. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his children through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 1:4-5, 11-12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no escaping that this is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s choice, rather than mine. And that is a wonderful thing. The Lord, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, does not make mistakes. He chose me. He chose you, Amy, in accordance with his pleasure and will. As for me, I make mistakes, and my own choices are always subject to suspicion and doubt. Not so the Lord! His plans and purposes prevail, for the praise of his glory. I, you, we are both his, forever, and no mistake! And thus we have assurance of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s more. He chose us to be holy and blameless in his sight. Partly that is an instantaneous, Jesus-died-for-my sins-and-now-I-am-counted-righteous thing. And partly it is a rest-of-my-life thing, as the Holy Spirit continues both to convict me and to empower me to change, as I surrender my will on the pathway to holiness. Both are life-giving, lavish gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what of evangelism? If people are chosen, where is repentance and belief? See what comes next in the passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God‚Äôs possession‚∏∫to the praise of his glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 1:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those to whom Paul writes &lt;em&gt;heard&lt;/em&gt; the message of truth (because someone told them), and &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt;. Predestination does not diminish the gospel message in any way. There is undeniably mystery here, but the greatest evangelist of all time was surely &amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;Paul himself&lt;/em&gt;, who wrote these words. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that you are his, Amy, and he is yours, forever, because he chose you in him before the creation of the world. üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does faith that changes the course of nations look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see something of it in the story of Naaman, in 2 Kings 5. The Lord had given victory to Syria through Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army (v1, how interesting), who suffered from leprosy. Previously, the Syrians had taken captives from Israel, and among them was a young girl, now a slave in the house of Naaman (v2). Not even named, and yet her faith makes her the hero of this story.  How would you expect a young girl, captive in a foreign land, to live? Not like this, surely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said to her mistress, ‚ÄúIf only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy‚Äù (v3).  Talk about not playing it safe and keeping your head down! What can we learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She was simply and humbly living her life, a slave in Naaman&amp;rsquo;s house, with no resentment or discontent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She had a generous heart, wishing good and not harm upon her captors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She had such a conviction that through Elisha the Lord would heal Naaman the commander of the army of a hostile nation, that she was prepared to put herself on the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did she speak out like this? What trouble would have come her way if there had not been a miraculous healing? Certainly the king of Israel himself expected the outcome to be conflict between nations (v7). Her faith is ridiculous. And so she is the reason that a pagan general&amp;rsquo;s life is turned around, he becomes a worshipper of the Lord, and takes his faith back to a pagan land, into the royal palace, no less (v18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to conclude that the Lord placed this on her heart, as he does. These were his plans and purposes, and they rested on the faith of a humble slave girl, who otherwise might simply have been living in obscurity. And on her obedience, oh my! Risk-taking, reckless obedience, to the one who is faithful beyond measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live with a faith that changes the course of nations, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we better perceive the Lord&amp;rsquo;s grace in all we experience, and what would that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is full of frustrations and disappointments. Even for the Christian seeking the Lord with all of our heart, living a surrendered life, putting him first in everything, things may not turn out as we would have wished. And that&amp;rsquo;s not just small things. The whole course of one&amp;rsquo;s life could turn out to be so different from what was desired. Where is our loving Heavenly Father in this? Does he not want to bless his children? Absolutely he does! So what is going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote to the Romans this oft-quoted verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider that in the context of Solomon&amp;rsquo;s wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/proverbs&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Proverbs 16:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has hopes and desires for their own life. Some may be sufficiently well organised to have a plan! But the Lord determines their steps. It is his plans and purposes that prevail. Let us not delude ourselves that we can control our own destiny, and somehow plan our way there. That is for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to dispel a misconception. Paul is not saying that everything that happens is good and is caused by God. That is observably false‚∏∫terrible things do happen. Rather he is saying that whatever happens, God works in it and through it ‚Äúfor the good of those who love him‚Äù. Let us be those!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us learn to see the world through the lens of Romans 8:28 as it actually is then. May we consciously receive God&amp;rsquo;s grace in all that happens. ‚ÄúIn all things‚Äù let us submit to his superior wisdom, knowing that there is no better eternal outcome than the one he has for us. When apparent disappointments come, let us receive them with a grateful heart. The Lord has seen things that we have not. His love is unfailing. He may very well be rescuing us from something we thought was better, but is in fact not.  He is the one who determines our steps, and it is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receive his grace with a grateful heart in all things, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
