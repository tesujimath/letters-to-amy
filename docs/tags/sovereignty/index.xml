      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we better perceive the Lord&amp;rsquo;s grace in all we experience, and what would that mean?
Life is full of frustrations and disappointments. Even for the Christian seeking the Lord with all of our heart, living a surrendered life, putting him first in everything, things may not turn out as we would have wished. And that&amp;rsquo;s not just small things. The whole course of one&amp;rsquo;s life could turn out to be so different from what was desired.</description>
