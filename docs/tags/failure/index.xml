&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from Matthew&amp;rsquo;s shaming and humiliation of David in his genealogy? Why is he so harsh? And is there any grace to be found here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David the king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 1:1, 5-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the humiliation⸺David&amp;rsquo;s shameful failure recorded here for all time. Notice that Bathsheba is identified but not named. Unlike Rahab and Ruth, those outsiders extraordinarily honoured by being named here, her inclusion in the genealogy isn&amp;rsquo;t remotely about her. It is in fact all about David, and it&amp;rsquo;s all about his most shameful failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David was chosen by God to be king, anointed by Samuel, and blessed by the Spirit (1 Sam 16:12-13). He was the slayer of Goliath, the Philistine champion who taunted the Israelites and defied the Lord (1 Sam 17). With humility and a grateful heart he acknowledged the greatness and kindness of the Lord (2 Sam 7), and experienced victory through him (2 Sam 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it all went horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king&amp;rsquo;s house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/2-samuel&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Samuel 11:1-2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the rest. David lusted after Bathsheba, committed adultery with her, and made her pregnant. He called her husband Uriah back from battle (where he himself should have been) and tried to get him to go home and sleep with his wife. After failing to trick that honourable man into covering his own dishonourable act, he had him murdered, and he took Bathsheba as his own wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/2-samuel&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Samuel 11:27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a sobering story for anyone who thinks at all highly of themselves. Anyone so self-satisfied in their naivety and self-deception and complacency as to regard themselves as secure from falling. What a solemn warning for us all! But isn&amp;rsquo;t this exactly why Matthew makes reference to this shameful deed in his genealogy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of us can say we are as sold-out for the Lord as was David? Which of us has so trusted the Lord as to go up for him armed with only with a sling and five smooth stones against a nine foot giant wearing bronze armour and bearing a huge spear? Which of us has lived such a life for the Lord as his?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, we are each as prone to shameful failure as was David. It is in our sinful nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 3:22-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where is the grace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is right there in the very first verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 1:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus identifies with such sinners as David, and with such sinners as us. See how David is honoured in this first verse. And we are honoured by Jesus&amp;rsquo; oh so costly choice to die for each one of us. He counted us worthy. He counts us worthy. It is so humbling! I weep in gratitude to my Lord and Saviour!  This gratitude together with the power of the indwelling Spirit keep me from falling.  Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s grace is more than our most shameful failures. David shows us that. Matthew shows us. And Jesus shows us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, Amy, that his grace is more than enough! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Denial</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/denial/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 06:15:00 +1200</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/denial/michael-held-g_Kde88IlvE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Denial" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the nature of Jesus&amp;rsquo; love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we journey this week towards Good Friday, towards the cross, let&amp;rsquo;s reflect on Jesus&amp;rsquo; journey towards that first Good Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had just eaten his last supper with the disciples in the upper room and washed their feet, and then said something none of them expected or wanted to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.” Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.” Jesus said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 22:31-34&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in such a familiar passage, here is something to notice afresh. Jesus refers to Peter by his pre-Christian name, Simon. Why is that? Remember that he had previously given him a new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 16:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does Jesus momentarily call him Simon here and then almost immediately Peter again? How interesting. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I think about this. The crux is not that he initially calls him Simon, but that he then calls him Peter, and this is what Jesus wants to emphasize. Even as he is foretelling his denial, Jesus is affirming him as Peter, his chosen one, Cephas the rock. Even in his denial he is still Peter. He is still Jesus&amp;rsquo; chosen one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only shortly afterwards it happened just as Jesus had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, “This man also was with him.” But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.” And a little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, “Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.” But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 22:55-60&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v61a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would have been in that look from Jesus? Disappointment surely, and sadness⸺sadness beyond imagining⸺but also love, such love. Steadfast love. Irrefutable love. The love that would send Jesus to the cross, in obedience to his Father, love even unto death. Love for Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v61b-62&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter realised he had denied the Lord who loved him, who had affirmed him, and who loved him still. And in his shame and wretchedness and humiliation he wept bitterly. At the time of crisis, when Jesus was going to his death, he, Peter, had been found not to be worthy. He was nothing but a shameful failure. How he wept over that failure, his failure to love Jesus as he loved him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us, as we approach Good Friday? Where does it leave me? What of my own denial? Anxiety that denies Jesus as Saviour. Vestigial sin that seeks to deny him as Lord. Here&amp;rsquo;s where: Jesus turns and looks at me, and he loves me. In love he stretched out his arms on that cross and died for me, and for you, Amy. I know I am not worthy of this love, but it makes no difference to Jesus. His love is irrefutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the nature of his great love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember his love for you, Amy, as we approach Good Friday, and praise him! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Biblical giants</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/biblical-giants/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 06:26:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/biblical-giants/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/biblical-giants/00_29_0496_Waipoua_Forest_NZ_-_Kauri_Baum_Tane_Mahuta.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Biblical giants" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you in awe of those giants of the faith we know from the Bible⸺Noah, Abraham, Moses, David⸺and how they managed to play a part in the purposes of God beyond anything we see in our times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, don&amp;rsquo;t be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being righteous and blameless and the reason humankind survived God&amp;rsquo;s purge of evil by the flood, Noah was just a man, and later got himself drunk and rather embarrassed himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard. He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 9:20-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And besides being the one who in hope against all hope believed and so became the father of many nations, Abraham was previously a coward and a liar (Genesis 12:10-20) and a man who gave up waiting on the Lord (Genesis 16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses too was a coward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said to him, “Who has made man&amp;rsquo;s mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD? Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.” But [Moses] said, “Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 4:11-13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some time later, even having witnessed the Lord&amp;rsquo;s miraculous deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, Moses&amp;rsquo; lack of faith caused him to make a heinous mistake at Meribah which was most severely punished by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/numbers&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Numbers 20:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses furthermore failed to take responsibility for this failure, and his later account to the Israelites was simply untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/deuteronomy&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Deuteronomy 3:26&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete our quartet of heroes we have David, that man after God&amp;rsquo;s own heart, that adulterer and murderer (2 Samuel 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What instead should we notice about these giants of the faith? They were all in fact frail and flawed human beings used by a mighty God for his Kingdom purposes. What was special about each of them was that God set his love upon them, and chose to work mightily through each one⸺just as he does for you, and just as he does for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer to the Hebrews makes exactly this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 12:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are surrounded by these heroes. They are not above or beyond us and nor should we be in awe of them. We should rather read of their best qualities and eagerly desire those, being fully persuaded that the Lord can do the same through each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live with Noah&amp;rsquo;s blamelessness and Abraham&amp;rsquo;s faith and David&amp;rsquo;s desire for the Lord, Amy, and run with endurance, knowing that the Lord will bless you with what you desire (Psalm 37:4) and use you mightily for his Kingdom purposes! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Casting off shame</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/casting-off-shame/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 06:27:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/casting-off-shame/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/casting-off-shame/allef-vinicius-oe_03B2Q5A4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Casting off shame" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what we do about ourselves, how can we possibly hold our head high?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David had a similar problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David was chosen by the Lord because he was a man after God&amp;rsquo;s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14). He earnestly sought the Lord and wrote many of the psalms which have blessed the generations.  But let us not make the mistake of thinking that he was a righteous man. His later life was in fact a catalogue of failure and shame, culminating in his most shabby and shameful moral failure, committing adultery with Bathsheba and murdering her husband Uriah the Hittite (2 Samuel 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, David wrote Psalm 3 when he was being pursued by his son Absalom, who was trying to kill him and seize control of the kingdom. What greater failure as a father could there be than that? How utterly shameful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet we read this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you, LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 3:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David was so aware that he had no glory of his own. He had only shame. But the Lord himself was his glory, and not only the reason that he could hold his head high, but the one who actually lifted his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Of course, this in no way diminishes the Lord&amp;rsquo;s condemnation of sin in one&amp;rsquo;s life. David was severely rebuked by the Lord after his wretched doings with Bathsheba. Repentance was very necessary. Forgiveness followed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it is for us. The nearer we draw to God and the more we focus on personal holiness, the more aware we become of our own failure and shame, all those reasons Christ died on the cross. We own those reasons. And yet, the Lord is my glory, the lifter of my head. Yours too, Amy! He chose us in him to be holy and blameless in his sight, and he will achieve his purposes. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins. Cast off the shame. He alone is my glory. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold your head high, Amy, and know that the Lord himself is your glory! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
