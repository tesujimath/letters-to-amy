        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/a-city-on-a-hill/gabriele-merlino-photographer-bnvubGJTyNg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A city on a hill" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we shine for Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jesus‚∏∫that&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing. Consider what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. Let your light so shine before others that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:14-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is the pivotal word here? The answer is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;, but it is not all that clear. To be sure, this is the alternative translation given in the footnote in the ESV. The mainline translation is like the NIV rendering, neither of which are particularly helpful: &lt;em&gt;In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this phrasing obscures what really matters. At times like this I turn to the NASB, the most literal translation of them all, the one that remains closest to the original language. Here&amp;rsquo;s what we find there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:16 (NASB)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see? &lt;em&gt;In such a way that they &amp;hellip; glorify your Father who is in heaven&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a way. That is how we must shine, for there are two strikingly different ways shining ones could be received. ‚ÄúOh wow, Simon is amazing, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?‚Äù Or, ‚Äúoh wow, have you noticed the transforming grace at work in Simon&amp;rsquo;s life? The Lord is amazing, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ego craves one of these but it is the other that glorifies the Lord. I must confess and repent and shine in such a way that they glorify my Heavenly Father. All the glory must go to him. That must be my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire, and so I must die to self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, the Apostle Paul focuses on the main point with exceeding clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For God, who said, ‚ÄúLet light shine out of darkness,‚Äù has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/2-corinthians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Corinthians 4:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am merely a clay jar, really nothing to behold at all, quite unimpressive and weak and somewhat vulnerable, but oh my, the treasure that I have within! The treasure that Jesus my Saviour has given me, that the Holy Spirit living in me is guarding and growing. The treasure that others must see as I live my life as a city on a hill. The treasure that will attract those outside the Kingdom to come in, and the treasure that will encourage my brothers and sisters in Christ to live lives that are ever more characterised by love and holiness. On dying to self, I find incredible joy in this city on a hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let your light shine in such a way, Amy, that they glorify your Father who is in heaven! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creation</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/creation/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 06:25:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/creation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/creation/apollo_17_blue_marble_photo_dec_7_1972_as17-148-22727.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Creation" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we reclaim the glorious and majestic creation story of Genesis 1 from those who would have us cringe in embarrassment at the naivety of it all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasn&amp;rsquo;t science come along and explained the universe? Hasn&amp;rsquo;t evolution come along and explained life itself? In these modern times hadn&amp;rsquo;t we better simply keep our heads down about this whole outdated, unsophisticated, and frankly ignominious description? By no means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And God said, ‚ÄúLet there be light,‚Äù and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 1:1-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since what I wrote last week began with what was so very dark, I have been musing on light, and my musing brought me to this. Let&amp;rsquo;s revel in the first day of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in intimate relationship, in the dance of the Trinity, an articulation of mutual love even before humankind is brought into existence. Can you sense the delight in anticipation in the hovering even before God speaks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need the introduction to John&amp;rsquo;s gospel to compete our picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 1:1-5, 14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brief account in Genesis 1, God the Father speaks the universe into existence, and Jesus is the agent of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this work? Wow! How bold am I even to try to dig into such a mystery?! But I have a simple analogy that has helped my own understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to scratch my ear, I merely think it and it is so. You could say I speak to my arm and it lifts, and to my finger and it scratches. It works like this because it is my own body and I have power over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entirety of the universe belongs to the Lord and he has absolute power over it. It is as much connected to his commands as my own arm is to mine. What an awesome God we serve! Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then we come to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 1:5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here some people start wringing their hands in embarrassment, and others start trying to calculate the age of the earth. But both responses are inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew word here translated day is &lt;em&gt;y√¥m&lt;/em&gt;. The same word appears throughout the Old Testament with various translations. Here&amp;rsquo;s just one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. The &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-chronicles&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Chronicles 29:26-27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;y√¥m&lt;/em&gt; for reigning over Israel was forty years. And furthermore, when we notice that God didn&amp;rsquo;t even create the sun, moon, and stars until the fourth day, perhaps we can stop worrying about what a day means in the creation story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God the Father who loves us, Jesus his only Son who saves us, and the Holy Spirit who lives in us, together created the universe and all that is in it, in a display of unspeakable power and wisdom and creativity. Let&amp;rsquo;s rest unashamedly in the mystery and majesty of that and praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise the Three in One who created it all, Amy, and try not to let your head explode with the vastness and wonder of it all! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Finding hope in the darkest times</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/finding-hope-in-the-darkest-times/jongsun-lee-F-pSZO_jeE8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Finding hope in the darkest times" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we find hope in the darkest times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of God have gone through some really dark times over the years, and among the worst would be during the time of the judges. But even as we start thinking about it, tell me this doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound just like 21st Century New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/judges&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Judges 17:6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start to get a sense of quite how horribly wrong things had gone from the story of an Israelite called Micah who stole 1100 pieces of silver from his own mother, albeit later restoring them to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And his mother said, ‚ÄúI dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/judges&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Judges 17:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could she have uttered anything more oppugnant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 20:4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply apostasy, when the people of God abandon holiness and all that is good and honouring to him, and go their own way. What followed shortly afterwards was therefore somehow inevitable. It is surely the very darkest story in the whole of Scripture. Brace yourself, for it is gut-wrenchingly awful. It is the story of a Levite and his concubine who had just embarked on a poorly planned and unwise journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him. When they were near Jebus, the day was nearly over, and the servant said to his master, ‚ÄúCome now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.‚Äù And his master said to him, ‚ÄúWe will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeah.‚Äù And he said to his young man, ‚ÄúCome and let us draw near to one of these places and spend the night at Gibeah or at Ramah.‚Äù So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/judges&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Judges 19:10-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having rejected as unsafe the foreign city of Jebus they instead took refuge in Gibeah, the city of the Benjamites‚∏∫one of the twelve tribes of Israel‚∏∫the people of God. What then happened at the house where they sheltered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, worthless fellows, surrounded the house, beating on the door. And they said to the old man, the master of the house, ‚ÄúBring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/judges&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Judges 19:22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúKnow‚Äù is a horrible euphemism which here means gang rape. Such was the hospitality of the people of that city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Levites were set apart for the service of the Lord, but this particular Levite was the vilest coward and he decided to sacrifice his concubine to save himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the man seized his concubine and made her go out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go. And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man&amp;rsquo;s house where her master was, until it was light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/judges&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Judges 19:25-26&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she died. The Levite chopped up her body and dispatched the twelve pieces throughout the land. The tribe of Benjamin was cast off by the rest of Israel. Shamed. Shunned. Civil war ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely the very darkest story in the Bible. Surely the very darkest of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where then is hope to be found?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a vital principle that must be understood, and here it is particularly clear. Hope is not found in the situation itself. The situation here is so very dark and utterly without hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we need to hear from Isaiah and from John the Apostle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/isaiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 9:2&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 1:5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always the case, but it is not usually quite so clearly seen, that there is true hope only in Jesus. Only in his death and resurrection. Only in the grace that flowed so freely at Calvary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have looked ahead by a thousand or so years, there&amp;rsquo;s something else to notice in this timeframe, which is Paul&amp;rsquo;s rebuke of a group of people who were thinking rather highly of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 3:4-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something had happened in those long years such that being of the tribe of Benjamin had been transformed from shame to honour. Exactly how this had been woven together from strands of grace over the years is beyond my understanding, but the end result is apparent, and such is redeeming grace. Such is resurrection victory. Such is the power of the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no shame that is beyond the redeeming power of the cross and the healing and restoring power of the resurrection. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that even in the very darkest times, Amy, hope remains! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
