        <title>Led by the Spirit</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/led-by-the-spirit/KTutanssail.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Led by the Spirit" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is there so much confusion today around what it means to be led by the Spirit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote recently about being led by the Spirit in the context of the grace-filled life, focusing on loving the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, and loving one another, unconditionally and without exception, in joyful surrender. Surrender is in fact the key word here and there is a bit more that needs to be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is remarkably easy to tell when someone is confused about what it means to be led by the Spirit, because you will hear them use words like ‚Äúdiscern‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the context in which Paul uses this expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons [and daughters] of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 8:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/galatians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:16-18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that being led by the Spirit is about putting to death the deeds of the body and not gratifying the desires of the flesh. This has nothing to do with understanding or insight! It is all about the power of the sanctified will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t do better than to quote Jim Packer on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twice Paul speaks of being ‚Äúled‚Äù by the Spirit (Romans 8:14; Galatians 5:18). Both times the reference is to resisting one&amp;rsquo;s own sinful impulses as the flip side of one&amp;rsquo;s practice of righteousness. Leads is rightly taken to mean ‚Äúguides‚Äù, but the guidance in view here is not a revealing to the mind of divine directives hitherto unknown; it is, rather, an impelling of our wills to pursue and practice and hold fast that sanctity whose terms we know already. Thus to be led and guided, says Paul, is the mark of a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;J.I. Packer, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Keep in Step with the Spirit, Chapter 3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An impelling of our wills to pursue and practice and hold fast that sanctity whose terms we know already. Now recall Packer&amp;rsquo;s premise from Chapter 1 of the very same book. &lt;em&gt;The primary work of the Holy Spirit is to mediate the presence of Jesus in our lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of Jesus in our lives is glorious, victorious, powerful, sanctifying. It enables us to surrender our will to what is right and true and pleasing to the Lord, &lt;em&gt;and to do it&lt;/em&gt;, for his glory and for our own eternal blessing. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrender your will, Amy, to the one who is faithful and true, to our glorious Saviour, and be led by the Spirit into a victorious life! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The grace-filled life</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-grace-filled-life/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-grace-filled-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-grace-filled-life/tom-morbey-r1SwcagHVG0-unsplash-cropped.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The grace-filled life" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are not under law but under grace, does it even matter what we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It matters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 6:1-4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How then can we learn to walk in newness of life, not under law but under grace? If all those long lists of commandments still apply, how are we not under law? And if not, how can we avoid living in sin? Certainly not by overlooking what Jesus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like us, the fledgling church in Galatia was under threat from those preaching works. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider what Paul wrote to them. Here&amp;rsquo;s the key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/galatians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, but that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big if! How can we know, and how can we be secure in that knowledge? Because there&amp;rsquo;s a grievous trap here which snares many, namely equating being led by the Spirit with living according to the convictions of one&amp;rsquo;s own heart. This is fraught with danger! Satan is the father of lies and the great deceiver, and by stroking our egos and flattering our vanity he can manipulate our feelings even and perhaps especially in this realm. How can we escape this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/galatians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:17, 19-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first list is truly shocking, and we might be tempted to think is far from where we live our lives, but consider idolatry for one‚∏∫in regard to career, reputation, and respectability, how evident is this in every church! Now, notice that eight out of these fifteen works of the flesh comprise dysfunctional relationship and unlove. There&amp;rsquo;s a clue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could being led by the Spirit in fact be quite straightforward? The opposite of dysfunctional relationship and unlove is simply, love. There&amp;rsquo;s more than love in the second list, of course, but that&amp;rsquo;s surely the headline. And what does Paul say elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; love is the fulfilling of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 13:10b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here indeed is the answer. We can live not under law but under grace by loving the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, and loving one another, unconditionally and without exception, in joyful surrender. Love that starts small must grow and grow and continue to grow‚∏∫this is the fruit of the Spirit. So simple, and yet learning to do this adequately will take each one of us the rest of our earthly lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live a life of love, Amy, led by the Spirit, as one not under law but under grace! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pray in the Spirit</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/pray-in-the-spirit/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 06:25:00 +1200</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/pray-in-the-spirit/manuel-meurisse-EuCll-F5atI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Pray in the Spirit" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the last piece of the armour of God that is so often overlooked, indeed not even thought of as armour by many?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Bible is about reading in paragraphs, which are the basic units of expression, things that belong together. Not every Bible translation has the same paragraph breaks, but in both of my preferred translations‚∏∫the NIV 1984 and the ESV‚∏∫the armour of God is described in just one paragraph, which in the NIV ends with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 6:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How interesting that Paul would conclude his writing about the armour of God with this. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider how praying in the Spirit could be considered a vital piece of the armour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, what does ‚Äúin the Spirit‚Äù even mean? There seems to be much confusion today about what is the work of the Holy Spirit. Jim Packer wrote a whole book about it, &lt;em&gt;Keep in Step with the Spirit&lt;/em&gt;, in which he outlines some of the secondary aspects that seem to occupy most people&amp;rsquo;s attention, including power, revelation, and promptings, before arguing that &lt;em&gt;the primary work of the Holy Spirit is to mediate the presence of Jesus in our lives&lt;/em&gt;. And indeed, this matches with what Jesus says of the Spirit in John 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Paul writes in Romans is closely related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 8:26&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not overthink this. Praying in the Spirit is simply praying in relationship with Jesus. There is no formula, just as there is no formula in human relationship. Mutual commitment and time spent together are required for the relationship to flourish. Jesus is committed! How he is that!! Are we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must do this on all occasions, and with all kinds of prayers and requests. Let&amp;rsquo;s not get into a rut of formulaic praying. Let&amp;rsquo;s sit with our wonderful Saviour and enjoy intimacy in relationship. In his presence we are protected in the spiritual battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice too that Paul&amp;rsquo;s instruction is to pray for all the saints, that is, all Christians. In the spiritual battle we must avoid at all cost turning in on ourselves, as if we are the ones who matter most. By no means! Our brothers and sisters in Christ are the ones we must love, and continue to lift up before the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests, Amy, for all the saints! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The master craftsman</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-master-craftsman/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 06:25:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-master-craftsman/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-master-craftsman/jonny-gios-KGL7Rw_-YPY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The master craftsman" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we be completely confident in surrendering to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s will? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we retain some level of control? What might he do in our lives, by the Holy Spirit unleashed with power and authority? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it just all too scary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me ask a different question which may provide some insight. If I invite the Spirit into my situation, into my life, how can I be sure he will do what I am hoping for? What I want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many leave this question unstated, and yet it remains in their subconscious, in the background, undermining confidence in the Lord and trust in him. But it must be articulated, because only then can we repudiate it. Of course he won&amp;rsquo;t do what I want! The very idea is preposterous! He will do his own work, the work that he knows so well, at which he is the master. So the better question to ask is, what is that work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already considered this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with exceeding joy‚∏∫to the only God our Saviour be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and for evermore! Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/jude&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jude v24-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work is to keep us from falling and to present us before his glorious presence without fault and with exceeding joy.  It is a heart work, where he transforms us from wretches, having the smallest, meanest, most selfish lives and motives, into sons and daughters, having abundance of life and joy in the Lord, living as slaves to righteousness, with hearts bursting with love for our Saviour and for our brothers and sisters in Christ. And he will do whatever it takes to achieve this purpose, no matter the cost, to him or to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I know that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all‚∏∫how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 8:32&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not make the mistake as some have done, of thinking this means he will give us whatever we want. By no means! But he will give us whatever &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; wants, in pursuit of his goal for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrender joyfully, Amy, and trust the master craftsman who knows his work, who along with his own Son, will graciously give you all things! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A deposit guaranteeing our inheritance</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/a-deposit-guaranteeing-our-inheritance/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 06:30:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/a-deposit-guaranteeing-our-inheritance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/a-deposit-guaranteeing-our-inheritance/ishan-seefromthesky-2d7n2sfYjHY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A deposit guaranteeing our inheritance" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we know for sure that all we are hoping for in eternity is real, and that it will be as promised?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m just about ready to leave this desert island, and I see a boat on the horizon (yay!), but first let&amp;rsquo;s look into Ephesians 1 for one last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God‚Äôs possession‚∏∫to the praise of his glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 1:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some really significant points to note here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we in or out? We have been &lt;em&gt;included&lt;/em&gt;. Most assuredly in! And not on our own merit, as if anyone could come along later and say, there&amp;rsquo;s been some mistake. No, we have been included &lt;em&gt;in Christ&lt;/em&gt;. The power and the glory are his, and we are included, in him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have been &lt;em&gt;marked in him with a seal&lt;/em&gt;. When a legal contract used to be signed, both parties would sign and apply a wax seal with the impression of a signet ring, as authentication. The Holy Spirit authenticates us as children of God, the genuine article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Holy Spirit is a &lt;em&gt;deposit&lt;/em&gt;, that is part of the greater whole which is to follow, paid immediately, as a foretaste. There is more to come!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deposit is a &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; of what is to come. What is to come is a certainty, and cannot be revoked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is guaranteed is &lt;em&gt;our inheritance&lt;/em&gt;. If we are children, then we are heirs‚∏∫heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are &lt;em&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s possession&lt;/em&gt;, bought with a price, and he will never give us up. I am his and he is mine, forever. You too, Amy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prize is our &lt;em&gt;redemption&lt;/em&gt;, which is already accomplished, but not yet complete. One day it will be so, and we will shed off all that tires us out and drags us down. How I long for that day!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit living in us not only proves our adoption by the Lord, but gives us power to live victoriously, a foretaste of what is certain, of what is promised and true. A deposit guaranteeing our inheritance! Now we can truly say this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 1:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise him, Amy, for such blessing as this! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
