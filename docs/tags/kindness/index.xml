        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/love-mercy/jon-tyson-nI8YlkExQoI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Love mercy" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why love mercy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/micah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Micah 6:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the ESV does have slightly unfamiliar wording here. All my Christian life I have known it as act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly. But the unfamiliar prompted me to look further into what this word mercy actually means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why love and not show? Why not “show mercy”? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that go better with those other doing words, act justly and walk humbly? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this purely about our behaviour? Not remotely! It is so much richer and deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word translated mercy or kindness is &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;. Over the last couple of weeks or so I have been on a journey into &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;, mainly thanks to Jim McClure. It has been rich and deep. As we come to understand &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; we come to understand something of the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; has been translated by a variety of words including mercy, kindness, goodness, favour, pity and loving-kindness. Sometimes it has been translated as faithfulness, grace, leal-love, steadfast love and troth. The fact that so many words have been employed to translate &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; reveals that it is extremely difficult to find an equivalent English word and every attempt is ultimately inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; is love that is covenantal and it is about relationship. God&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; is wonderful, ever present, always surrounding, universal, superlative, quick to pardon, immense in its essence, immense in its duration, immense in its quantity, and, remarkably, can be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim McClure, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://connectingwithyou.net/2016/12/12/words-of-life-5-loyal-love-chesed/&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Adapted from Words of Life #5, Loyal Love — Chêsêd&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where else does this word appear? Everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing &lt;em&gt;steadfast love&lt;/em&gt; to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 20:5b-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the paths of the LORD are &lt;em&gt;steadfast love&lt;/em&gt; and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 25:10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: The &lt;em&gt;steadfast love&lt;/em&gt; of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/lamentations&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lamentations 3:21-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By loving &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; we are loving an essential and fundamental attribute of God&amp;rsquo;s character, and ultimately we are loving God himself. By immersing ourselves in this mercy and kindness, joyously and with grateful hearts, we fall more deeply in love with our Lord and Saviour, and that changes us. How we need this mercy! The overwhelmingly good news is that it flows freely⸺as and because Jesus&amp;rsquo; blood flowed freely on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we receive this it becomes a part of us and starts to define our own character, such that we become people of mercy, &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; people. Jesus talked about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s observe what it looks like to love mercy, to live for it and because of it. Can you hear the longing here, such deep longing, for the Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let your &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt; come to me, O LORD, your salvation according to your promise; then shall I have an answer for him who taunts me, for I trust in your word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 119:41-42&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when we live with such deep longing for the Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;? The answer is, we put a smile on the face of our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his &lt;em&gt;chêsêd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 147:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love mercy, Amy, and put a smile on the face of your Heavenly Father! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Water into wine</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/water-into-wine/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 06:25:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/water-into-wine/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/water-into-wine/07_FB_Wedding_Cana_1024.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Water into wine" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we miss out on the Lord&amp;rsquo;s blessing being poured out in our lives by fumbling and stumbling?  Isn&amp;rsquo;t it part of the human condition to make mistakes? But where do our mistakes leave us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re guessing that much of what follows was written yesterday morning, coinciding with the low point of your recent rollercoaster ride, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be far wrong! I am so pleased that you&amp;rsquo;ve had a personal experience of the goodness and kindness of the Lord to draw on in future, Amy, should such a thing happen again. And let me further encourage your heart with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember Jesus&amp;rsquo; first miracle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 2:1-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How presumptuous of Mary, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? Or is it simply that she knew her son, his character, and his kindness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it. When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 2:6-10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that Jesus performed miracles? To authenticate himself and his ministry, and to bring great power to his call to repentance and his invitation to enter the Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Jesus says nothing about who he is or why he has come. There is no call to repentance, and no invitation. It is as he says to his mother, “My hour has not yet come.” He has not yet started his ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did he change the water into wine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could ask a similar question of Elisha making the axe-head float (2 Kings 6:1-7). Elisha&amp;rsquo;s miracle was no great public show to refute the pagans or to demonstrate the power and authority of the Lord. It was a private little miracle done out of kindness to rescue one man from the consequences and shame of a simple mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was with Jesus. Even ahead of starting his ministry, he took pity on that wedding family who had misjudged provisioning of the wine. Embarrassment would have ensued, but not really major disaster. Nevertheless, Jesus stepped in with grace and kindness and not only undid the consequences of their mistake, but provided above and beyond, his wine being the best that was served at that celebration. Hallelujah! What a Saviour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apostle Peter understood this more than most, and for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-peter&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Peter 5:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus himself is kindness personified (Titus 3:4-5). We see this not only in the wedding wine of Cana, but also in the communion wine of the last supper, in his blood of the covenant poured out at Calvary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cast all your anxiety on him, Amy, now or at a future time, because he cares for you! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emptiness and exhaustion</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/emptiness-and-exhaustion/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 06:24:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/emptiness-and-exhaustion/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/emptiness-and-exhaustion/brut-carniollus-jGEsapFCLgw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Emptiness and exhaustion" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can we learn from Elijah&amp;rsquo;s faith-wobble?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was running for his life, and after 120 miles or so he left his servant and continued alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he himself went a day&amp;rsquo;s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, “It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-kings&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Kings 19:4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was a man empty and exhausted, utterly cast down, apparently at his end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, “Arise and eat.” And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, “Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.” And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-kings&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Kings 19:5-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey to Horeb was at least another 250 miles. What a cake that must have been!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice what was the Lord&amp;rsquo;s first response⸺not that gentle rebuke which was to follow. The first response was practical and compassionate care and provision for his servant who was empty and utterly exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what? Elijah poured out his heart to the Lord, and you can be sure the tears were streaming down his face. Read for yourself the words of a broken man with nothing left to give, without hope and apparently all alone (1 Kings 19:10, 14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what was the Lord&amp;rsquo;s response to that? He rescued him and restored him and gave him something to do (1 Kings 19:15-18). Let me paraphrase it like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;rsquo;s ok, Elijah, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this. And by the way, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. I have seven thousand others. And you are still useful to me. Come on, let&amp;rsquo;s go again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus the Lord restored Elijah, gave him hope, and continued to work out his plans and purposes through him and through Elisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then [Elisha] arose and went after Elijah and assisted him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-kings&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Kings 19:19, 21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same God who looks with such love on each one of us in our own brokenness and emptiness and exhaustion, and rescues and restores, and continues to use us for his Kingdom plans and purposes. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His grace is sufficient for you, Amy, for his power is made perfect in your weakness! 🙏❤️&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thankfulness that glorifies</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/thankfulness-that-glorifies/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 06:24:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/thankfulness-that-glorifies/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/thankfulness-that-glorifies/joshua-clay-VNjNtdu0yCw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Thankfulness that glorifies" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can our thankfulness glorify the Lord?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will praise God’s name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 69:30&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an aspect to thankfulness that I want to explore this week, which is this: receiving kindness from those around us as from the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone treats me with particular kindness, who am I likely to thank? Too often we think in purely human terms, but there&amp;rsquo;s another dimension here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s one side of the coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfil his good purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/philippians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 2:13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 2:10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord has plans and purposes, and he works in and through each one of us to fulfil them. He works even in the lives of those who neither honour nor acknowledge him. We know this. Now consider the other side of that coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that the Lord delights in exercising kindness (Jeremiah 9:24)⸺this is one of his good purposes! So when we receive kindness from others, why would we not make that connection and ascribe it to him? To do so makes my soul sing in gratitude to my Saviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I experienced exactly this, twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one occasion I was in church, after the morning service. Church can be the loneliest place, and I was facing the bleak prospect of a Sunday afternoon by myself, at a time when I was particularly downcast. Just outside church and completely out of the blue, a friend invited me mountain biking that afternoon, in a way that seemed so random and so kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other was on my birthday, and I was at home in a melancholic mood. Suddenly there was a knock on my back door. It was my neighbour, with a slice of apple shortcake she had just made, and a little tub of cream to go with it. How lovely. She had no idea it was my birthday, nor did I tell her. How random again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have learned that these random acts of kindness are not remotely random. I ascribe them to my Heavenly Father, and thank him. And through these he makes known his own character, his overflowing kindness, and he is glorified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise God’s name in song, Amy, and glorify him with thanksgiving! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unmasking the true villain</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/unmasking-the-true-villain/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/unmasking-the-true-villain/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/unmasking-the-true-villain/adnan-khan-VS2C5_GI_MM-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Unmasking the true villain" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this life like Scooby-Doo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Scooby-Doo episode I can remember ends in the same way. The mystery villain is finally unmasked by the gang and is seen to be a familiar character, who then says, “And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for you meddling kids!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul tells a similar tale in his letter to the Ephesians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 6:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an important lesson there is here. How often life can seem so adversarial, with obstacles being put in our way by people who are frankly, just so annoying! Aargh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead we can step back and regain perspective, discerning who is the real enemy and recognising that we are in the middle of a spiritual battle in the heavenly realms, the Holy Spirit will be able to equip us with everything we need to face this. That is the only way to prevail in the spiritual battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of hostility, for example, may we respond with gentleness and kindness towards the one who is not our enemy. Hearts are healed like this, the Lord is glorified and the devil thwarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this asking too much though? How could we possibly live like this? Paul tells us how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armour of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil&amp;rsquo;s schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 6:10-11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s clearly a bit to be said about the armour of God. For now, though, be a meddling kid and unmask the true villain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your struggle is not against flesh and blood, Amy, so put on the full armour of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/kindness/limor-zellermayer-cANocSiow7g-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Kindness" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is one of the most important considerations when engaging with someone in a difficult conversation? When everything within you wants to make your point, to justify yourself with great vigour? When you have waited for so long and the time is now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fruit of the Spirit is &amp;hellip; kindness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/galatians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How easy this is to overlook. Could I be overstating its importance though? I think not. Consider this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,” declares the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/jeremiah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeremiah 9:24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindness is remarkably prominent don&amp;rsquo;t you think? And the Lord delights in it! And what of this, which characterizes Jesus as the embodiment of kindness and love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the kindness and love of God our Saviour appeared, he saved us &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/titus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Titus 3:4-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider those who hurt us, and don&amp;rsquo;t even know they have.  What better way is there to bless than with kindness? There&amp;rsquo;s real power in this, power to heal, and power to save. It is a work of the Holy Spirit that we can live like this, in giving rather than receiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with &amp;hellip; kindness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/colossians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Colossians 3:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be filled with kindness, Amy, breathing it out as a blessing from the Holy Spirit! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
