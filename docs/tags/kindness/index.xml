      <description>Dear Amy,
How is this life like Scooby-Doo?
Every Scooby-Doo episode I can remember ends in the same way. The mystery villain is finally unmasked by the gang and is seen to be a familiar character, who then says, “And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for you meddling kids!”
Paul tells a similar tale in his letter to the Ephesians.
 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
What is one of the most important considerations when engaging with someone in a difficult conversation? When everything within you wants to make your point, to justify yourself with great vigour? When you have waited for so long and the time is now?
 The fruit of the Spirit is &amp;hellip; kindness
― Galatians 5:22 How easy this is to overlook. Could I be overstating its importance though? I think not.</description>
