&lt;p&gt;What reason is there to rejoice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the fact that Jesus is alive and reigning and ruling over the nations with power and authority and compassion and kindness, we find some more reasons in Psalm 118.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD has disciplined me severely, but he has not given me over to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD is God, and he has made his light to shine upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 118:1, 6, 14, 18, 27a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s something in particular I want to focus on. Something that enables us to rejoice even though our earthly future is uncertain in regard to &amp;hellip; so many things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 118:24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by living in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; day, really living in it, enjoying the goodness and kindness and steadfast love and faithfulness of the Lord in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; day, only by this may we really grasp what Jesus meant when he said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 10:10b&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by living in this day, fully living in it, are we able to grasp hold of what it is the Lord is doing in us and through us, for his glory and for the advancement of his Kingdom, and to surrender to it and to become a part of it, and then to rejoice! Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s more. There&amp;rsquo;s a whole other dimension to this day. Let&amp;rsquo;s read that stanza in its entirety‚∏∫remember context!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the LORD. This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it. I thank you that you have answered me and have become my salvation. The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is the LORD&amp;rsquo;s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 118:19-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus quoted this (Luke 20:17) and he himself is the cornerstone. So there is another ‚Äúthis day‚Äù, and it is the day of salvation. This is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the day that the Lord has made, Amy. Rejoice and be glad in it! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My soul magnifies the Lord</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 08:55:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/benjamin-davies-FiZTaNTj2Ak-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post My soul magnifies the Lord" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does true worship look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the so-called worship songs we sing in church fall far short, often because there is a bit too much me in them. There are however some that emphatically do not, for example ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb‚Äù and ‚ÄúHere I Bow‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe Who is Mighty‚Äù. I want to dwell in the latter today, because its bridge in particular is the epitome of true worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now my soul magnifies the Lord&lt;br&gt;
I rejoice in the God Who saves&lt;br&gt;
I will trust His unfailing love&lt;br&gt;
I will sing His praises all my days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sovereign Grace Music, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxPvMJB--R4&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;He Who Is Mighty&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically there are three ‚ÄúI‚Äùs and two ‚Äúmy‚Äùs here, and yet this is in fact completely focused on the Lord. Singing this lifts me directly into his presence in joyous worship, losing myself in praise and awe and wonder‚∏∫this is the real thing! And the heart of it is ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is taken from Mary&amp;rsquo;s song of praise, the Magnificat, her response to her cousin Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s ‚ÄúBlessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!‚Äù after Mary&amp;rsquo;s humble acceptance of and joyful surrender to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s revelation to her (Luke 1:26-56).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just consider what Mary had gone through. The archangel had appeared to her and told her she was going to be the unmarried mother of the Son of God. On a human level, consider the shame she would face‚∏∫indeed, Joseph had in mind to break the marriage pledge quietly (Matthew 1:19). What was Mary&amp;rsquo;s response to the angel? That humble acceptance and joyful surrender:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Mary said, ‚ÄúBehold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:38&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder the angel had said to her, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.‚Äú (Luke 1:30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word translated &lt;em&gt;magnify&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;megalun≈ç&lt;/em&gt;, and is the same word translated &lt;em&gt;shown&lt;/em&gt; in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbours and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:57-58&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnifying here is that of the Lord himself making known his great mercy‚∏∫the character and person of God being revealed and made known‚∏∫and the only right response is one of praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean, ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù?  Simply that all that is within me, the very core of my being, reveals and makes known and honours the character and person of God, and is aligned in love and praise and worship and affirmation that the Lord is great and so worthy of praise. This is what we were created for by our Heavenly Father who knows us and loves us beyond understanding, and it is incomparably joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May your soul magnify the Lord, Amy, and may you rejoice in the God who saves! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Joy</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/joy/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 08:15:00 +1300</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/joy/mi-pham-FtZL0r4DZYk-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Joy" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we choose joy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fruit of the Spirit is &amp;hellip; joy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:22&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t joy something that from time to time lands on us, thrills our heart, and lifts us into the Lord&amp;rsquo;s presence? How can we choose this for ourselves? In fact we can, and understanding this is the key to a deeper, richer, more joyous walk with the Lord, independent of the circumstances of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a clue in Paul&amp;rsquo;s command (a command, no less!) to the Philippians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 4:4&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says it again because it is of such great importance. We must understand this! But how can we rejoice when life is hard, and sorrow and pain feature so prominently in our world and in our lives? Paul tells us almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable‚∏∫if anything is excellent or praiseworthy‚∏∫think about such things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 4:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are these things we must think about, exactly? I am grateful to Jim Packer for presenting this so clearly, thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God loves me, infinitely and eternally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything comes to me from God, at least with his permission and always under his protection, to further my eternal good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus, which will eternally increase, is something supremely worth having.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gospel message of salvation that I seek to pass on to others is something supremely worth giving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;J. I. Packer, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Laid-Back Religion? Chapter 6: Joy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By meditating on these matters constantly and faithfully, springs of joy well up in our hearts, turning our Christian walk into ‚Äúan experience of contentment and exaltation of which the world knows nothing‚Äù ‚Äï &lt;em&gt;J.I. Packer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose joy, Amy, and meditate on the uplifting and glorious truths of the Lord! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gentleness</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/gentleness/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 06:27:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/gentleness/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/gentleness/david-clode-13PjNBaDMcg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Gentleness" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the most Christlike response we can give to an angry, frustrated, hostile, hurting world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fruit of the Spirit is &amp;hellip; gentleness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:22-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note about the fruit of the Spirit is that there is only one fruit (‚Äúthe fruit of the Spirit &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip;‚Äù), and that fruit has nine characteristics. I may take nine weeks over this, let&amp;rsquo;s see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But gentleness? Why do I start here? Let&amp;rsquo;s notice what Paul wrote to Timothy, his final urging in his first letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you, man of God, flee from all this [false teaching and the love of money], and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Timothy 6:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy, still young, was just starting out in ministry, but was already held in high regard by Paul, who was particularly fond of him (1¬†Cor¬†4:17; 2¬†Tim¬†1:2; Phil¬†2:20-22). What would we write to such a one? If we&amp;rsquo;re honest, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it seem a little surprising to see gentleness in that list of other more obvious qualities? It must be more important than we thought!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, in his final exhortations to the Philippians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Philippians 4:4-5&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord is near, and what is the thing that really matters (besides rejoicing)? Our &lt;em&gt;gentleness&lt;/em&gt;. We see this in Jesus himself. How prominently is his gentleness described, both in prophecy, and by and of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Zechariah 9:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bruised reed he will not break, and a smouldering wick he will not snuff out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Isaiah 42:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 11:28-30&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In gentleness and humility, Jesus offers a haven for the weary and burdened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pressure cooker of this life, Amy, live with the gentleness of Christ! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
