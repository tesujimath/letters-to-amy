      <description>Dear Amy,
What difference does it make to have been rescued?
Cycling back from Karitane on Sunday afternoon, I saw my neighbours walking up the hill and stopped to say hello. They asked about the awful thing that happened to me in Rarotonga. Word evidently gets around! Instead I told them about the wonderful, impossible thing which happened, which resulted in me being alive and not dead.
Then I found myself saying, â€œevery day feels like a bonus now.</description>
