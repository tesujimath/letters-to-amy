        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/from-glory-to-glory/joshua-j-cotten-dMn92oICKFY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post From glory to glory" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can those made in the image of God be transformed into his image? Isn&amp;rsquo;t that a bit, well, circular?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we all, with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Corinthians 3:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chapter Paul is contrasting the old and new covenants, characterising the old covenant as ‚Äúthe ministry of death‚Äù (v7) and ‚Äúthe ministry of condemnation‚Äù (v9), oh my! What do we need to know to understand what he writes here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope in the new covenant is in the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness‚∏∫our righteousness in Christ, purchased at such great cost‚∏∫a permanent glory (v8-11). In contrast, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, while his face initially shone with the reflected glory of the Lord, he covered himself with a veil so that the Israelites would not see how quickly it faded (Exodus 34:29-35).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s follow Paul&amp;rsquo;s reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end. But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Corinthians 3:12-17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who live under the old covenant live with a veil over their hearts to cover the shame of failing to live up to what is required, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why then are we so bold? Because we stand in Christ&amp;rsquo;s righteousness, not our own. Hallelujah! Our faces are unveiled because there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). Only through Christ is the veil taken away. No condemnation. No fear. No shame. Freedom is ours! Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we, the rescued ones, beloved of God, are being transformed from one degree of glory into another. What we were created to be has not yet been seen in our lives. Assuredly we were made in the image of God, but that became so tarnished by sin, by that rebellion against God passed down through the ages from the first man and the first woman. There is, however, such a joyous anticipation in the ongoing process of sanctification, of being made holy, through which we will be made into that which we were always meant to be. And get this: &lt;em&gt;we ourselves are fully a part of that process&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For in his great wisdom, in the mystery of his marvellous ways, the Lord chooses to involve us in that transformation. It comes when we surrender our will to the Holy Spirit, and when we do, how it comes! Look at the lovely way that Paul describes those who are being transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.‚Å†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Corinthians 3:3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that you are a letter from Christ, Amy, written on the tablet of your own heart, a witness before the nations to his great love and mercy and grace and his power to transform into his own likeness! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Led by the Spirit</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/led-by-the-spirit/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 07:00:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/led-by-the-spirit/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/led-by-the-spirit/KTutanssail.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Led by the Spirit" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is there so much confusion today around what it means to be led by the Spirit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote recently about being led by the Spirit in the context of the grace-filled life, focusing on loving the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, and loving one another, unconditionally and without exception, in joyful surrender. Surrender is in fact the key word here and there is a bit more that needs to be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is remarkably easy to tell when someone is confused about what it means to be led by the Spirit, because you will hear them use words like ‚Äúdiscern‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the context in which Paul uses this expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons [and daughters] of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 8:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:16-18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that being led by the Spirit is about putting to death the deeds of the body and not gratifying the desires of the flesh. This has nothing to do with understanding or insight! It is all about the power of the sanctified will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t do better than to quote Jim Packer on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twice Paul speaks of being ‚Äúled‚Äù by the Spirit (Romans 8:14; Galatians 5:18). Both times the reference is to resisting one&amp;rsquo;s own sinful impulses as the flip side of one&amp;rsquo;s practice of righteousness. Leads is rightly taken to mean ‚Äúguides‚Äù, but the guidance in view here is not a revealing to the mind of divine directives hitherto unknown; it is, rather, an impelling of our wills to pursue and practice and hold fast that sanctity whose terms we know already. Thus to be led and guided, says Paul, is the mark of a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;J.I. Packer, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Keep in Step with the Spirit, Chapter 3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An impelling of our wills to pursue and practice and hold fast that sanctity whose terms we know already. Now recall Packer&amp;rsquo;s premise from Chapter 1 of the very same book. &lt;em&gt;The primary work of the Holy Spirit is to mediate the presence of Jesus in our lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of Jesus in our lives is glorious, victorious, powerful, sanctifying. It enables us to surrender our will to what is right and true and pleasing to the Lord, &lt;em&gt;and to do it&lt;/em&gt;, for his glory and for our own eternal blessing. Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrender your will, Amy, to the one who is faithful and true, to our glorious Saviour, and be led by the Spirit into a victorious life! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My soul magnifies the Lord</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 08:55:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/my-soul-magnifies-the-lord/benjamin-davies-FiZTaNTj2Ak-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post My soul magnifies the Lord" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does true worship look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the so-called worship songs we sing in church fall far short, often because there is a bit too much me in them. There are however some that emphatically do not, for example ‚ÄúWorthy is the Lamb‚Äù and ‚ÄúHere I Bow‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe Who is Mighty‚Äù. I want to dwell in the latter today, because its bridge in particular is the epitome of true worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now my soul magnifies the Lord&lt;br&gt;
I rejoice in the God Who saves&lt;br&gt;
I will trust His unfailing love&lt;br&gt;
I will sing His praises all my days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sovereign Grace Music, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxPvMJB--R4&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;He Who Is Mighty&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically there are three ‚ÄúI‚Äùs and two ‚Äúmy‚Äùs here, and yet this is in fact completely focused on the Lord. Singing this lifts me directly into his presence in joyous worship, losing myself in praise and awe and wonder‚∏∫this is the real thing! And the heart of it is ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is taken from Mary&amp;rsquo;s song of praise, the Magnificat, her response to her cousin Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s ‚ÄúBlessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!‚Äù after Mary&amp;rsquo;s humble acceptance of and joyful surrender to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s revelation to her (Luke 1:26-56).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just consider what Mary had gone through. The archangel had appeared to her and told her she was going to be the unmarried mother of the Son of God. On a human level, consider the shame she would face‚∏∫indeed, Joseph had in mind to break the marriage pledge quietly (Matthew 1:19). What was Mary&amp;rsquo;s response to the angel? That humble acceptance and joyful surrender:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Mary said, ‚ÄúBehold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:38&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder the angel had said to her, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God.‚Äú (Luke 1:30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word translated &lt;em&gt;magnify&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;megalun≈ç&lt;/em&gt;, and is the same word translated &lt;em&gt;shown&lt;/em&gt; in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. And her neighbours and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 1:57-58&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnifying here is that of the Lord himself making known his great mercy‚∏∫the character and person of God being revealed and made known‚∏∫and the only right response is one of praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean, ‚Äúmy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù?  Simply that all that is within me, the very core of my being, reveals and makes known and honours the character and person of God, and is aligned in love and praise and worship and affirmation that the Lord is great and so worthy of praise. This is what we were created for by our Heavenly Father who knows us and loves us beyond understanding, and it is incomparably joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May your soul magnify the Lord, Amy, and may you rejoice in the God who saves! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The master craftsman</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-master-craftsman/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 06:25:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-master-craftsman/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-master-craftsman/jonny-gios-KGL7Rw_-YPY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The master craftsman" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we be completely confident in surrendering to the Lord&amp;rsquo;s will? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we retain some level of control? What might he do in our lives, by the Holy Spirit unleashed with power and authority? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it just all too scary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me ask a different question which may provide some insight. If I invite the Spirit into my situation, into my life, how can I be sure he will do what I am hoping for? What I want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many leave this question unstated, and yet it remains in their subconscious, in the background, undermining confidence in the Lord and trust in him. But it must be articulated, because only then can we repudiate it. Of course he won&amp;rsquo;t do what I want! The very idea is preposterous! He will do his own work, the work that he knows so well, at which he is the master. So the better question to ask is, what is that work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already considered this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with exceeding joy‚∏∫to the only God our Saviour be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and for evermore! Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jude v24-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work is to keep us from falling and to present us before his glorious presence without fault and with exceeding joy.  It is a heart work, where he transforms us from wretches, having the smallest, meanest, most selfish lives and motives, into sons and daughters, having abundance of life and joy in the Lord, living as slaves to righteousness, with hearts bursting with love for our Saviour and for our brothers and sisters in Christ. And he will do whatever it takes to achieve this purpose, no matter the cost, to him or to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I know that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all‚∏∫how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 8:32&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not make the mistake as some have done, of thinking this means he will give us whatever we want. By no means! But he will give us whatever &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; wants, in pursuit of his goal for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrender joyfully, Amy, and trust the master craftsman who knows his work, who along with his own Son, will graciously give you all things! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The rescued life</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/the-rescued-life/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 06:28:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/the-rescued-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-rescued-life/kyle-cottrell-QGSD-bfJHIw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The rescued life" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What difference does it make to have been rescued?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling back from Karitane on Sunday afternoon, I saw my neighbours walking up the hill and stopped to say hello. They asked about the awful thing that happened to me in Rarotonga. Word evidently gets around! Instead I told them about the wonderful, impossible thing which happened, which resulted in me being alive and not dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I found myself saying, ‚Äúevery day feels like a bonus now.‚Äù And so it is. But this principle applies equally to the original rescue, the body-and-blood-of-Christ one that saved each one of us from our sin and brought us into relationship with our Heavenly Father in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we live as those rescued? We need to understand what has changed, and so experience each waking moment as a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are not your own; you were bought at a price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Corinthians 6:19-20&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 6:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rescue changes everything! Recognizing that we now belong to the one who rescued us and our lives are no longer our own, may we surrender joyfully to the Holy Spirit, live as slaves to righteousness, and know the complete life-transformation that brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Galatians 5:22-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This crucifying of the sinful nature sounds like a one-time thing, but is in fact a lifelong journey. May we travel it with grateful hearts, never forgetting the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in step with the Spirit, Amy, and continue to live as one rescued! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
