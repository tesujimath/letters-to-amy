      <description>Dear Amy,
Certain passages or verses in the Bible are really hard to understand. How should we approach them?
My intention this week was to write about telling a mountain to throw itself into the sea, not doubting. But when I looked into the context, I found that Jesus said it after cursing the fig tree on approaching Jerusalem for the last week of his life. How do we understand that?</description>
