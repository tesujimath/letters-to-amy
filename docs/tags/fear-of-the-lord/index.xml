      <description>Dear Amy,
So, how do we grow in reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done? Because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just happen. It takes serious get-up-early-and-cry-out-to-God hard work, every single day. Work. But not without incredible joy.
Psalm 119 helps. I won&amp;rsquo;t quote it here, because, well, it&amp;rsquo;s quite long. I have been including the first 32 verses in my daily readings for several years now.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we know the will of the Lord? Let&amp;rsquo;s look again into the treasure trove which is Psalm 25.
Who, then, are those who fear the LORD? He will instruct them in the ways he chooses (v12). The LORD confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them (v14).
Tim Keller defines the fear of the Lord as this, in a sermon from Proverbs on the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom.</description>
