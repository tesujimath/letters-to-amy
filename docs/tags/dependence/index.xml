      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we obey a command if we don&amp;rsquo;t know what it means?
Obviously we can&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s a rhetorical question. What of this then?
 Taste and see that the LORD is good.
― Psalm 34:8  This is clearly an instruction to do something. It&amp;rsquo;s a command. Notice that David could have written, Behold! The Lord is good (because he is). That&amp;rsquo;s a true statement, but it&amp;rsquo;s not what he wrote.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
What does it mean to receive the kingdom of God like a little child?
What a vital question! Jesus himself said:
 “Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”
― Luke 18:17  We must fathom this then! Let&amp;rsquo;s consider three aspects of a little child&amp;rsquo;s relationship with their earthly parents, and infer how to receive from our Heavenly Father.</description>
