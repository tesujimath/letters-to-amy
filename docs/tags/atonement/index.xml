      <description>Dear Amy,
Firstly, why am I writing to you on a Tuesday rather than a Wednesday? As you know, I like to ask the big questions, so let&amp;rsquo;s start with that! In fact, Megan and I are in Glenorchy, just about to embark on the Rees-Dart track, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be out of coverage for the next four days, and that&amp;rsquo;s the reason. With that out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the next big question.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
What is the turning point in the Easter story?
In fact there are two. We&amp;rsquo;ll come to the joyous second, but let&amp;rsquo;s not rush that. Now is the time to contemplate the mournful first.
I have been reading Mark&amp;rsquo;s account of the last days of Jesus&#39; life, from the triumphal entry into Jerusalem up until his death on the cross (Mark 11-15). There&amp;rsquo;s much that happens, starting with Jesus clearing the temple, which had become a den of robbers.</description>
