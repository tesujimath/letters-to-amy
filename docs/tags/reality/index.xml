        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/blinded-by-seeing/matrix-digital-rain.png" alt="Featured image of post Blinded by seeing " /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does a mighty prophet of God lose his faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re surely familiar with the glorious story of Elijah on Mount Carmel, where he defeated the prophets of Baal and so was revealed who is the true God (1 Kings 18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, ‚ÄúSo may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.‚Äù Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-kings&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Kings 19:2-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding Jezebel&amp;rsquo;s threat to kill him, how does ‚Äúhe was afraid‚Äù make any sense given what had just happened? In fact it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a fascinating paper about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pivotal term in our text is the Hebrew word &lt;em&gt;wayyar º&lt;/em&gt;, the first word in verse three. This common verbal form should be translated ‚Äúthen he saw‚Äù (from &lt;em&gt;rƒÅ º√¢&lt;/em&gt;). &amp;hellip; Virtually all of the more recent translations of the Bible have opted for another reading, the Hebrew &lt;em&gt;wayy√ÆrƒÅ º&lt;/em&gt;, ‚Äúand he was afraid‚Äù (from &lt;em&gt;yƒÅrƒì º&lt;/em&gt;¬†).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this &amp;hellip; most Hebrew manuscripts read ‚Äúand he saw‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ronald Barclay Allen, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/22/22-3/22-3-pp193-202_JETS.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Elijah the Broken Prophet, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 22/3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen goes on to argue how ‚Äúhe saw‚Äù is surely what was originally written, and is in fact the only translation which makes any sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How had Elijah defeated the Baals? By exercising incredible faith in the infinite power and steadfast faithfulness of the invisible God. The invisible God who cannot be seen is the one who defines reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what did Elijah do next. He saw. He looked at the so-called real world, and the pseudo-reality that he saw defeated him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul writes about the reason for our courage and confidence in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For we walk by faith, not by sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/2-corinthians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;2 Corinthians 5:7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking by sight means looking at the visible world around us as all there is, or at least the most part of it. How this defeats us! It defeated Elijah, that mighty prophet of God, who ran for his life and hid in a cave, where he was rebuked by the Lord (albeit with great tenderness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There he came to a cave and lodged in it. And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here, Elijah?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-kings&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Kings 19:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you hear the love in that rebuke? Read the rest of 1 Kings 19 for further insight into the loving kindness and provision of our Heavenly Father. Elijah had gone off-script. He had momentarily lost his faith, precisely because he saw, and he thought that what he saw was the true reality. It was not, as the Lord showed him with such patience and love and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the infinite power and the steadfast love and faithfulness and the great kindness of the invisible God, Amy, and walk by faith not by sight! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Faith vs reason</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/faith-vs-reason/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/faith-vs-reason/dan-cristian-padure-h3kuhYUCE9A-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Faith vs reason" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does radical faith require us to switch off our intellect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dear friend of mine has been having what I would call a faith crisis. In the context of my ongoing waiting on an impossible promise from the Lord, he cannot relate to someone who he would say is living in the hope of something that contradicts the observed and obvious reality. He asks, how could I have abandoned reason and switched off the rational part of my brain in quite such a naive way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I argue that in fact the opposite is true, and that I have brought all my intellect and understanding to bear in my faith situation. How so? And what does the Bible have to say about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/proverbs&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Proverbs 9:10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of wisdom is &lt;em&gt;applied intellect&lt;/em&gt;, that is intellect used to align a life with knowledge of the Holy One in a practical way, in order to live that life on the right path.  And wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord. Recall Tim Keller&amp;rsquo;s definition: ‚ÄúThe fear of the Lord is a reverent awe and wonder before the greatness of who God is and what he has done.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Lord of all creation loves me to the extent that he gave up his only Son to an excruciating death in order to rescue me, and has promised abundant life and ongoing rescue in him, the only rational response is to completely cast myself upon his love, trusting him, absolutely. Anything less betrays a lack of understanding of the eternal reality. (Sadly it seems to me that few indeed are able to rationalize to this extent.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this rational response look like then? Here&amp;rsquo;s what. Diving headfirst into the wellspring of life. Living confidently on the firm foundation of such a promise from the Lord.  Ruthless consistency is the key which unlocks the understanding to be able to live like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so radical faith in the one who is faithful and true is in fact the only way to live with intellectual integrity. Having tested it, we must lean into it as the foundation of our life. Nothing else makes any sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live with radical faith, Amy, employing all of your intellect to live a life increasingly aligned with your growing knowledge of the Holy One! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How can we love the Lord this much?</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/how-can-we-love-the-lord-this-much/nikola-jovanovic-OBok3F8buKY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How can we love the Lord this much?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we love the Lord this much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a clue in Revelation 4:8, where the four living creatures, day and night, never stop saying: ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.‚Äù  And in Revelation 5:9, where together with the twenty-four elders, they sing to Jesus, ‚Äú&amp;hellip; you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two people are in love, truly, madly, deeply, they think about each other a lot. Like, all the time! Detachment from reality may be observed. They think about each other&amp;rsquo;s attributes, the very best, and it fuels their love. David does this of the Lord in Psalm 145.  ‚ÄúEvery day I will praise you‚Äù (v2) because ‚Äúgreat is the LORD and most worthy of praise‚Äù (v3) ‚Äú&amp;hellip; and I will meditate on your wonderful works‚Äù (v5). He goes on to remind himself and us of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s attributes (v8-9, 13-14, 17-20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read these verses. Meditate on them. Dwell in them. Express your love for the Lord through them. Put him at the centre, and lift him high. Adore him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must do this day and night, never ceasing, all the time!  ‚ÄúMy mouth will speak in praise of the Lord &amp;hellip; for ever and ever‚Äù (v21).  Let us detach from the pseudo-reality that deceives us, and embrace the eternal reality. Let us feed and water our love for the Lord with endless praise, so it grows and grows, for his glory, and by his power and transforming grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love him more, Amy! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
