      <description>Dear Amy,
What is the world&amp;rsquo;s favourite pastime?
What is it that people love to do? That the whole media machine is geared up to deliver? At which society has become so very accomplished? Here&amp;rsquo;s what: taking offence.
Taking offence â€” human nature delights in it, Christians too at times, sadly. We love to be outraged. It is almost tribal. People bond over it, which means that people also divide over it, for there is always a source of the offence, and that source is surely a person.</description>
