      <description>Dear Amy,
What does it mean to receive the kingdom of God like a little child?
What a vital question! Jesus himself said:
 “Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”
― Luke 18:17 We must fathom this then! Let&amp;rsquo;s consider three aspects of a little child&amp;rsquo;s relationship with their earthly parents, and infer how to receive from our Heavenly Father.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
How can we be expectant and not disappointed?
Living with high expectations of oneself and others is surely right, but can lead to ongoing disappointment, as we and those around us fall short of what we aspired to do and to be. How can the same not be true of the Lord?
What should we expect of the Lord anyway? “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (Jn 10:10).</description>
