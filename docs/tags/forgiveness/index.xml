      <description>Dear Amy,
Knowing what we do about ourselves, how can we possibly hold our head high?
David had a similar problem.
David was chosen by the Lord because he was a man after God&amp;rsquo;s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14). He earnestly sought the Lord and wrote many of the psalms which have blessed the generations. But let us not make the mistake of thinking that he was a righteous man. His later life was in fact a catalogue of failure and shame, culminating in his most shabby and shameful moral failure, committing adultery with Bathsheba and murdering her husband Uriah the Hittite (2 Samuel 11).</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
What is it about those who love the Lord with all of their heart, soul, mind and strength which is so profoundly attractive?
 Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.
― Psalm 34:5 When John had a vision on the island of Patmos of the risen Lord Jesus, he tried to describe the indescribable for us, concluding:
 His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
Here&amp;rsquo;s a well loved verse from John&amp;rsquo;s first letter, that we may be in danger of reading too quickly and missing the most important word.
 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
― 1 John 1:9 There are some important words here. Confess. Sins. And some wonderful, lifting words. Faithful. Forgive. Purify. But what am I referring to?</description>
