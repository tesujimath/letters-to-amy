      <description>Dear Amy,
What is it about those who love the Lord with all of their heart, soul, mind and strength which is so profoundly attractive?
 Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame. (Psalm 34:5)
 When John had a vision on the island of Patmos of the risen Lord Jesus, he tried to describe the indescribable for us, concluding:
 His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.</description>

      <description>Dear Amy,
Here&amp;rsquo;s a well loved verse from John&amp;rsquo;s first letter, that we may be in danger of reading too quickly and missing the most important word.
 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (1 Jn 1:9)
 There are some important words here. Confess. Sins. And some wonderful, lifting words. Faithful. Forgive. Purify. But what am I referring to?</description>
