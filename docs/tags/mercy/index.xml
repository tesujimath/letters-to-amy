        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/what-now/nathan-trampe-oOmwruKXv5U-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What now?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three years your time in the village has finally come to an end! You have served the Lord so faithfully, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not wrong in saying that you have put a smile on the face of your Heavenly Father (Psalm 147:11). Well done! Well done indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some may see your return to New Zealand as a home-coming, perhaps for you it seems to be the opposite, as you are leaving the village and the friends who have been home to you for these three long years, with whom you have journeyed sharing joys and sorrows, trials and triumphs. And as you return you&amp;rsquo;ll surely feel like a stranger in a strange land, for isn&amp;rsquo;t that what New Zealand has become?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly how it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the writer to the Hebrews describes the faith of Abel and Enoch and Noah and Abraham and Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/hebrews&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hebrews 11:13-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living in western affluence can become so self-satisfied and complacent, distracted by comfort and privilege. Expect to find this thoroughly jarring on your return. But know that this is not your home. It is not my home. It is not any of ours. We long for a better country, a heavenly one. And in this longing of ours, astonishingly, God is not ashamed to be called our God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be my last letter to you, Amy. It has been such a privilege to be able to offer you these small encouragements from afar, and I have certainly encouraged my own heart as I have sought the Lord over what to offer to you. I have one last offering for you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my question. How can I live a life of humility and contentment, honouring the Lord in the midst of all this self-satisfaction and complacency and privilege, when all around me people with agendas are chasing after the limelight and my own life seems rather small and disregarded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David has the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering. Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and my mind. For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 26:1-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I am called to live, and it is joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; love is before my eyes because I think about it all the time. In fact it is the lens through which I see the world. It rescues me and enables me even to live my life. And the overflow of that love spills into every relationship and every conversation. It is life-changing love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise him for his wonderful &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; love and faithfulness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk in your integrity, Amy, and in his faithfulness! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hope for the hopeless</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/hope-for-the-hopeless/hoach-le-dinh-5DJqsjAYlmk-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Hope for the hopeless" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Tamar included in Matthew&amp;rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 1:2-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In over forty generations only five women are mentioned. We already considered the varied and different reasons for the inclusion of Rahab, of Ruth, and of Bathsheba. The fifth and final is Mary the mother of Jesus. The first is Tamar. But why Tamar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this primarily about Tamar, or is it about Judah? I have been pondering this long and hard. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I came to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Judah. Joseph&amp;rsquo;s older brother, he was the one who sold Joseph into slavery. Later he took a Canaanite woman for a wife and had three sons by her: Er, Onan, and Shelah. Tamar became his daughter-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. But Er, Judah&amp;rsquo;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what [Onan] did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 38:7, 10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. Two sons so thoroughly wicked that the Lord put them both to death. We can infer what Judah&amp;rsquo;s own heart was like from the selling of his own brother into slavery and the Canaanite marriage and the family values, and it was unprincipled and ungodly and vile and dishonourable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar was no better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when Tamar was told, ‚ÄúYour father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,‚Äù she took off her widow&amp;rsquo;s garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage. When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. He turned to her at the roadside and said, ‚ÄúCome, let me come in to you,‚Äù for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 38:13-16&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamar tricked her father-in-law Judah into having sex with her, and Judah thought he was having sex with a cult prostitute. What a pair! Neither one redeems the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that unlike Bathsheba and David, Tamar never became Judah&amp;rsquo;s wife. She is only ever described as his daughter-in-law. Perez and Zerah were illegitimate children. There was no marriage. What an absolute mess, and yet there it is, in the genealogy of Jesus no less!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And note too that what they had done is found among that long list of abominable sexual practices in Leviticus 18, a sordid list which includes incest, adultery, bestiality, and homosexual practice, about all of which the Lord said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDo not make yourselves unclean by any of these things, for by all these the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean, and the land became unclean, so that I punished its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/leviticus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Leviticus 18:24-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then do we make of Tamar&amp;rsquo;s inclusion in the genealogy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Tamar and Judah were unmitigated reprobates, absolute shockers. But that&amp;rsquo;s exactly the point, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? That&amp;rsquo;s exactly the point that Matthew is making by including her in the genealogy. What hope is there for such as them? Didn&amp;rsquo;t Jesus come precisely to bring hope to the hopeless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúGo and learn what this means: ‚ÄòI desire mercy, and not sacrifice.‚Äô For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 9:13&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah! What a Saviour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise the name of Jesus, Amy, the one who came not to call the righteous, but sinners! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Love mercy</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/love-mercy/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/love-mercy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/love-mercy/jon-tyson-nI8YlkExQoI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Love mercy" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why love mercy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/micah&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Micah 6:8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the ESV does have slightly unfamiliar wording here. All my Christian life I have known it as act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly. But the unfamiliar prompted me to look further into what this word mercy actually means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why love and not show? Why not ‚Äúshow mercy‚Äù? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that go better with those other doing words, act justly and walk humbly? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this purely about our behaviour? Not remotely! It is so much richer and deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word translated mercy or kindness is &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt;. Over the last couple of weeks or so I have been on a journey into &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt;, mainly thanks to Jim McClure. It has been rich and deep. As we come to understand &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; we come to understand something of the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hebrew &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; has been translated by a variety of words including mercy, kindness, goodness, favour, pity and loving-kindness. Sometimes it has been translated as faithfulness, grace, leal-love, steadfast love and troth. The fact that so many words have been employed to translate &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; reveals that it is extremely difficult to find an equivalent English word and every attempt is ultimately inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; is love that is covenantal and it is about relationship. God&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; is wonderful, ever present, always surrounding, universal, superlative, quick to pardon, immense in its essence, immense in its duration, immense in its quantity, and, remarkably, can be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adapted from Jim McClure, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://connectingwithyou.net/2016/12/12/words-of-life-5-loyal-love-chesed/&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Words of Life #5, Loyal Love ‚Äî Ch√™s√™d&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where else does this word appear? Everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing &lt;em&gt;steadfast love&lt;/em&gt; to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 20:5b-6&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the paths of the LORD are &lt;em&gt;steadfast love&lt;/em&gt; and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 25:10&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: The &lt;em&gt;steadfast love&lt;/em&gt; of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/lamentations&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lamentations 3:21-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By loving &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; we are loving an essential and fundamental attribute of God&amp;rsquo;s character, and ultimately we are loving God himself. By immersing ourselves in this mercy and kindness, joyously and with grateful hearts, we fall more deeply in love with our Lord and Saviour, and that changes us. How we need this mercy! The overwhelmingly good news is that it flows freely‚∏∫as and because Jesus&amp;rsquo; blood flowed freely on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we receive this it becomes a part of us and starts to define our own character, such that we become people of mercy, &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; people. Jesus talked about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBlessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s observe what it looks like to love mercy, to live for it and because of it. Can you hear the longing here, such deep longing, for the Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let your &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt; come to me, O LORD, your salvation according to your promise; then shall I have an answer for him who taunts me, for I trust in your word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 119:41-42&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when we live with such deep longing for the Lord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt;? The answer is, we put a smile on the face of our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his &lt;em&gt;ch√™s√™d&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/psalms&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Psalm 147:11&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love mercy, Amy, and put a smile on the face of your Heavenly Father! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Denial</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/denial/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 06:15:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/denial/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/denial/michael-held-g_Kde88IlvE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Denial" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the nature of Jesus&amp;rsquo; love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we journey this week towards Good Friday, towards the cross, let&amp;rsquo;s reflect on Jesus&amp;rsquo; journey towards that first Good Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus had just eaten his last supper with the disciples in the upper room and washed their feet, and then said something none of them expected or wanted to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSimon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.‚Äù Peter said to him, ‚ÄúLord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.‚Äù Jesus said, ‚ÄúI tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 22:31-34&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in such a familiar passage, here is something to notice afresh. Jesus refers to Peter by his pre-Christian name, Simon. Why is that? Remember that he had previously given him a new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnd I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 16:18&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does Jesus momentarily call him Simon here and then almost immediately Peter again? How interesting. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I think about this. The crux is not that he initially calls him Simon, but that he then calls him Peter, and this is what Jesus wants to emphasize. Even as he is foretelling his denial, Jesus is affirming him as Peter, his chosen one, Cephas the rock. Even in his denial he is still Peter. He is still Jesus&amp;rsquo; chosen one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only shortly afterwards it happened just as Jesus had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, ‚ÄúThis man also was with him.‚Äù But he denied it, saying, ‚ÄúWoman, I do not know him.‚Äù And a little later someone else saw him and said, ‚ÄúYou also are one of them.‚Äù But Peter said, ‚ÄúMan, I am not.‚Äù And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, ‚ÄúCertainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.‚Äù But Peter said, ‚ÄúMan, I do not know what you are talking about.‚Äù And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 22:55-60&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v61a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would have been in that look from Jesus? Disappointment surely, and sadness‚∏∫sadness beyond imagining‚∏∫but also love, such love. Steadfast love. Irrefutable love. The love that would send Jesus to the cross, in obedience to his Father, love even unto death. Love for Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, ‚ÄúBefore the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.‚Äù And he went out and wept bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;v61b-62&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter realised he had denied the Lord who loved him, who had affirmed him, and who loved him still. And in his shame and wretchedness and humiliation he wept bitterly. At the time of crisis, when Jesus was going to his death, he, Peter, had been found not to be worthy. He was nothing but a shameful failure. How he wept over that failure, his failure to love Jesus as he loved him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us, as we approach Good Friday? Where does it leave me? What of my own denial? Anxiety that denies Jesus as Saviour. Vestigial sin that seeks to deny him as Lord. Here&amp;rsquo;s where: Jesus turns and looks at me, and he loves me. In love he stretched out his arms on that cross and died for me, and for you, Amy. I know I am not worthy of this love, but it makes no difference to Jesus. His love is irrefutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the nature of his great love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember his love for you, Amy, as we approach Good Friday, and praise him! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ought to occupy our thinking at the beginning of a new year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several possible answers to that question. Here&amp;rsquo;s mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe LORD is my portion,‚Äù says my soul, ‚Äútherefore I will hope in him.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him. It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/lamentations&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lamentations 3:21-26&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These few verses are a shaft of light in the book of Lamentations which otherwise makes for a sobering read. The backdrop is the destruction of Jerusalem after an eighteen month siege by Nebuchadnezzar, and the exile of Judah to Babylon. It was the grimmest of times. The city was plundered and its inhabitants taken into captivity. Women were raped; priests, prophets and officials executed. There was famine so severe that mothers were eating their own children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, this was the Lord&amp;rsquo;s judgment on his own people, his chosen ones, for their ongoing waywardness and apostasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judah has gone into exile because of affliction
and hard servitude; &amp;hellip; because the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem sinned grievously; therefore she became filthy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which was brought upon me, which the LORD inflicted on the day of his fierce anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/lamentations&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lamentations 1:3, 5, 8, 12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the just and holy judgment of our God whose name is Jealous, a consuming fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should tremble as we read, and then repent and expel every last sin from our own lives and purge every wrong thought and every crooked motive from our own hearts and minds. The Lord takes seriously our sanctification, our holiness, and so must we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But marvel that it is in the midst of this tribulation that the writer expresses hope in the steadfast love and faithfulness of the Lord. Even in the judgment there is mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Lord will not cast off forever, but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love; for he does not afflict from his heart or grieve the children of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/lamentations&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lamentations 3:31-33&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed. From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/malachi&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Malachi 3:6-7&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases and his mercies never come to an end. Put all your hope in him for this new year, Amy, for great is his faithfulness! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What to pray for</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/what-to-pray-for/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 06:24:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/what-to-pray-for/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/what-to-pray-for/marcel-smits-Wt6JoSxrsvU-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What to pray for" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we know what we should pray for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a responsibility here, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? After all, Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;John 14:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a prayer meeting where someone was sharing a prayer request, and they seemed to take aeons to lay out every painstaking detail about their situation? Well, we can&amp;rsquo;t risk praying for the wrong thing, can we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But could there be another way to see this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re surely familiar with the story of Joseph. After being sold into slavery by his brothers and thrown into prison in Egypt for a crime he didn&amp;rsquo;t commit, God raised him up to be second only to Pharaoh himself in all the land, and used him to deliver the Israelites from famine. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 47:27&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some years later, however, things apparently weren&amp;rsquo;t going quite so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 2:23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this really what God had intended? Had it somehow all gone horribly wrong? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. God saw the people of Israel‚∏∫and God knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 2:24-25&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God knew. He didn&amp;rsquo;t need to be told. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as if he hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed what was happening to his people, his chosen ones, his beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what happened? What happened is that God met with Moses in the burning bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the LORD said, ‚ÄúI have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/exodus&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Exodus 3:7-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God already knew what he was going to do and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t merely to alleviate the suffering of the Israelites. He was going to bless them far beyond that, far beyond imagining, gifting to them a land flowing with milk and honey‚∏∫a land that would demonstrate his sovereign choice, his faithfulness to his covenant promise, his grace and kindness to his people, and ultimately his rescue for all of humankind. No-one was asking for this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/ephesians&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ephesians 3:20-21&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply cry out to God, Amy, Lord have mercy! He already knows what to do. üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Black and white?</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/black-and-white/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 06:25:00 +1300</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/black-and-white/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/black-and-white/rafael-rex-felisilda-U_Kz2RnfFAk-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Black and white?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean in practice to be a people not under law but under grace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace. What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 6:14-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law and grace: are these in opposition? Jesus sets the highest standards in the Sermon on the Mount, then freely forgives and restores, refusing to let law limit grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a couple of contemporary issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-timothy&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Timothy 2:12&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely this was a cultural thing that no longer applies, and so surely these days women are free to pursue a preaching ministry? Surely? Except for the very next verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-timothy&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 Timothy 2:13-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. Paul is making a creational argument here, which seems to be as clear as it is harsh. Not something that can be so easily brushed aside then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose however to hold no opinion about this, and instead I choose to honour those women who have wrestled with this themselves and are honouring and serving the Lord through a preaching ministry. Wrestling is certainly required, but who am I to seek to impose my own view into someone else&amp;rsquo;s life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, I have my own issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúBecause of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 19:8-9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this prevent the Lord from rescuing me from the shame of my own life after a failed marriage? Is grace trumped by law here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How tempted we are to be black and white about the lives of others, yet rather grey about our own. Show me the one who does not find themselves on the wrong side of particular verses in the Bible, and does not have to cast themselves upon God&amp;rsquo;s mercy even to live their life. Does such a one exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus himself faced a law versus grace issue in relation to the Fourth Commandment, and on one occasion when confronted by the Pharisees, he related the story of David apparently breaking the law by eating with his men consecrated bread from the temple, before concluding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI tell you, something greater than the temple is here. And if you had known what this means, &amp;lsquo;I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,&amp;rsquo; you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 12:6-8&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that under grace everything is in fact somewhat grey? By no means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything rather is lit by a dazzling technicolour explosion of grace and redemption from the Lord, and that particular mercy which triumphs over judgment. This enables some women to pursue a preaching ministry for his glory, some divorced men to remarry by his grace, and others to live their lives in dependence on the riches of his mercy. Praise the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that this in no way removes or diminishes our call to live as slaves to righteousness, fully surrendered and walking in obedience with the Lord. (I will undoubtedly have to revisit this aspect of ‚Äúnot under law but under grace‚Äù.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live your life for his glory, Amy, as one not under law but under grace, and praise the Lord! üôèüôå&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Uneven blessing</title>
        <link>https://letterstoamy.org/uneven-blessing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 06:24:00 +1200</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://letterstoamy.org/uneven-blessing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/uneven-blessing/atul-pandey-0f3bZHXZSz8-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Uneven blessing" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that some seem to receive more bounteous blessing from the Lord than others? How is that fair? And how is it congruent with a God of justice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with fair, and let&amp;rsquo;s be frank. What would be fair would be for each one of us to be cast into the fiery pit. And collectively, we must take responsibility through our wretched ancestors for much of the suffering of humankind, for we share the same rebellious spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBecause you have &amp;hellip; eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‚ÄòYou shall not eat of it,‚Äô cursed is the ground because of you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/genesis&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Genesis 3:17&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, and this is a wonderful, unmerited, joyous but,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/1-john&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;1 John 1:9&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a rescue! What a Saviour! Praise him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with grateful, praising hearts, in fear and trembling, let us dare to ask again, how is it that God&amp;rsquo;s blessing is quite so unevenly distributed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul grappled with such a question in relation to the election of the Gentiles and God&amp;rsquo;s apparent rejection of the nation of Israel (Romans 9-11). That he takes three chapters over this shows us that such questions are no small matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take some of his arguments and apply them to the more general question of uneven blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God&amp;rsquo;s part? By no means! For he says to Moses, ‚ÄúI will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 9:14-15&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all mercy, and it is all undeserved. And let us not forget that the giver is the Creator God of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honourable use and another for dishonourable use? What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 9:21-23&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow in the unevenness of the blessing, God is making known the riches of his glory. Paul also shows us how to respond in the face of the apparent injustice of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brothers, my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 10:1&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And observe the extent of his love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 9:2-3&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this then the key to understanding? Even as we cry out to God over the unevenness of the blessing, is this our opportunity to learn how to truly love, and in so doing to glorify God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 25:35-36, 40&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the Lord enlarge our hearts for this broken world as we look around and see places where his blessing seems to be absent. And let us cry out to him for mercy, to the Lord, our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you think we have arrived at a place of only partial understanding, let us observe that Paul himself, the great apostle and teacher, is in just that place after three chapters of his own wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 11:33, 36&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cry out, Amy, to the one who is wise beyond understanding, and in places of meagre blessing love with his own love, from him and through him and to him, for his glory forever! üôè&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 07:05:00 +1200</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://letterstoamy.org/the-tar-pit/krystian-piatek-JUqXOPOYXEg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The tar pit" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever chosen to take the opposite view than the one you would naturally hold, and found insight? Let&amp;rsquo;s do that now. Let me commend to you the Pharisee, and let us find much to admire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this so hard? We have learned for the longest time to despise the Pharisees. I mean, they&amp;rsquo;re the baddies, right? Well let&amp;rsquo;s put that to one side for now. Jesus said of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/matthew&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Matthew 5:20&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly Paul appealed to the Philippians about his own impeccable standards as a Pharisee (Philippians 3:4-6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees were nothing if not serious about honouring the Lord, putting many of us to shame with the level of discipline with which they lived their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as I strive to live a right life, exercising all of my discipline to honour the Lord, how do I see myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would do well to consider this parable of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTwo men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed about himself: &amp;lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other men‚∏∫robbers, evildoers, adulterers‚∏∫or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBut the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &amp;lsquo;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/luke&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Luke 18:10-14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I observe someone struggling in life, am I tempted to think, I&amp;rsquo;m not like them?  And am I pleased not to be so?  Are you tempted to think likewise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despising the Pharisee prevents me from seeing the truth, which is in fact, such am I. No different from the one I disdain. No better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no difference &amp;hellip; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 3:22-24&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find I am in truth stuck in the tar pit of self-righteousness with my Pharisaical heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God‚∏∫through Jesus Christ our Lord!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚Äï &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://letterstoamy.org/ref/romans&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Romans 7:24-25a&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing my eyes on Jesus I cry out, Lord, I repent of my Pharisaical heart. Have mercy on me, a sinner. Rescue me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honour the Lord with your whole heart, with your whole life, Amy, and cry out to him, Lord, have mercy on me! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
